# Zenith — production image, built on Next's `output: "standalone"` tracing.
#
# Installing dependencies and pulling base images require network access.
# Fonts are self-hosted in public/fonts; Next compilation does not fetch them.
# Both production and Docker builds are mandatory CI gates.
#
# Layout follows the official Next standalone example:
# https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker

# Frozen (`ci`, not `install`) and script-free: no dependency's install/postinstall
# runs while the image is built, so a compromised transitive package cannot bake
# itself into the image. Nothing in this tree needs a lifecycle script — the only
# three packages that declare one are `esbuild` (its platform binary comes from
# the `@esbuild/*` optional package, resolved at require time), `fsevents`
# (macOS-only, optional, never installed here) and `unrs-resolver` (its native
# binding likewise resolves from the installed platform package). Evidence:
# `npm ci --ignore-scripts` in a scratch copy of this lockfile installed 698
# packages, after which `require("esbuild")` transformed TypeScript and
# `unrs-resolver`'s native `ResolverFactory` loaded. That was on win32-x64, not
# this image's linux/musl — see docs/hosted/PROVIDERS.md for what is unverified.

# a scratch directory and merged into /app/node_modules rather than installed
# there, because `npm ci` empties the node_modules of the directory it runs in
# and /app/node_modules is Next's traced standalone tree.
