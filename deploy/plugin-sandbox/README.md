# Reference plugin sandbox

The executable is `npx --no-install tsx src/cli/plugins/bin.ts plugin run ...`.
Use `--help` for arguments. The integrator must dispatch `plugin` from the main
Zenith CLI to `runPluginCli` to provide the `zenith plugin run` spelling.

The launcher requires a local signed manifest, its human-reviewed canonical
digest, trusted publisher keys, a local Node22 Linux image by immutable digest,
and a freshly issued dedicated scoped `za_` child token through stdin. It does
not read saved login credentials or `ZENITH_TOKEN`. Artifact download uses the
signed HTTPS URL without authentication or redirects, is capped at 16 MiB,
and must match the signed SHA-256 before container creation. There is no image
pull, host extraction, host command supplied by the manifest, or unsigned mode.

The plugin container has no IP network, runs as uid/gid 65532, has a read-only
root filesystem, drops all capabilities, sets no-new-privileges, and has bounded
CPU, memory, processes and scratch storage. A public-payload host scratch bind
is read-only. A private 1 MiB tmpfs Docker volume supplies a Unix socket; it is
read-only in the plugin. No Docker socket, parent directory, home, credential
store or platform store is mounted. Each of two containers has 128 MiB memory,
no swap, 0.25 CPU and 32 processes; `/work` is a 64 MiB tmpfs charged against
the memory limit. Large packages can exceed the memory limit and are refused
by the runtime; these limits are deliberately fixed.

Only the trusted gateway has IP networking. It forwards JSON MCP v3 calls to
one configured HTTPS origin, owns upstream authorization, permits only the
live lease's tools and targets, filters discovery, refuses incoming bearers,
cookies, other routes, batches, arbitrary RPC and redirects. It checks live
authority before each request and every second. Request bodies, responses,
concurrency and request durations are bounded. The Node22 fetch adapter lets
plugins use `fetch(ZENITH_URL + '/api/agent/v3/mcp', ...)` through that socket.
Other transports need explicit socket support; there is no networking fallback.

Only one signed stdio server is supported per launch: command `node`, first
argument `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/path/to/module.mjs` or `.js`, optional plain args,
and optional `ZENITH_API_VERSION=3`. Packages must be gzip ustar archives with
at most 256 regular files/directories and 64 MiB expanded size. Links, PAX/GNU
extensions, devices, traversal, duplicate paths and archive modes are refused.
Put the entry at the archive root or use its exact signed relative path. No
installation scripts run. The plugin receives only the dedicated child token
and public configuration. Plugin stdout/stderr are suppressed; this reference
command supervises lifetime and exit status, and does not provide a host stdio
MCP bridge or claim Claude Code/Codex interoperability.

The host rechecks authority every second, with a 3-second request timeout.
Revocation, expiry, review/lease changes, gateway failure, authority outages and
cancellation cause forced removal of both containers and then the owned volume.
Forced container removal kills all descendants, including TERM-resistant ones.
Dispatch already accepted by Zenith is not undone by killing the plugin.
Cleanup failures are errors and retain host scratch; operators should remove
only the positively owned `zenith.plugin.launch` resources after repair.

`POST /api/integrations/plugins/launch/check` is an explicit integration seam.
It is absent in the base worktree. Until the integrator supplies authoritative
review plus dedicated `za_` child issuance/revocation, the executable refuses
with `launch_authority_unavailable` before fetching or creating resources.
An ordinary linked `za_` token cannot self-assert this authority, and existing
plugin `zp_` issuance is not a fallback. See the contract, Mac verification
commands and known joins in `docs/build/production/verify/PROD-UX-03.md`.
