# AWS live acceptance: owner runbook

DEC-CLOUD is **unapproved**. No live cloud call or spend was performed by this job. This packet builds the AWS provider-fixture layer and a narrow `ProductScenarioPort` join for the concurrently assembled Wave 5 release journeys. It never promotes a ledger state or release flag.

## What this source can prove

`scripts/acceptance/aws-live.ts --plan` prints every SDK command, IAM action, exact request input, resource scope and maximum attempt count, with a plan SHA-256 and provisional cost. It does not resolve credentials, construct an SDK client or contact a control plane. Production scenarios are chosen with `--scenario fixtures` (the default: every fixture family, all 27 requirements in scope) or `--scenario retention-s3` (S3 fixture only, scope PROD-OPS-07; the other rows are reported pending as "outside this run's scope"). `ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_SCENARIO` is the equivalent input. The scenario is part of the plan digest and therefore of the owner's signed envelope; a permission for one scenario is refused for the other. The packet verdict is `failed` on any failure or open journal, `passed` when every in-scope requirement passed live, otherwise `incomplete`. Existing A-J planning and local J remain reachable with `--scenario` letters; legacy real AWS journeys explicitly refuse until their clients join the exact production permission envelope. Their authority/quiescence cleanup refusals are preserved.

Live provider fixtures create one private encrypted S3 bucket and nonce object, a bounded IAM nonce-function role, one ARM64 128MiB Lambda echo function, an **empty** ECS cluster, a private encrypted 20GiB PostgreSQL RDS instance and a disposable reserved `.invalid` Route53 zone/TXT record. They independently read ownership and provider state; Lambda invokes real code and S3 compares real object bytes. Empty ECS cluster state is not a running application. RDS configuration is not SQL traffic or restore proof. Reserved-zone readback is not public DNS, domain ownership, ACME or TLS evidence.

Every ledger row requiring `live_sandbox` is included with its acceptance text and AWS fixture dependencies. Full MIX, MAN, OPS and REL journeys need Wave 5's real release integration (including GCP/Azure and managed Kubernetes where required). `ProductScenarioPort.verify` is the small join contract in `scripts/acceptance/live/contracts.ts`; this CLI intentionally has no injected implementation. It must run the product's normal quotas -> authority/intent -> semantics/authorization -> custody -> effect ledger -> provider path, use human browser approvals, prove real independent traffic/readback, and settle accepted operations before teardown. Extending its calls requires extending the deterministic plan and obtaining a new permission approval. Neither fixture success nor an interface implementation that simply returns `complete: true` is acceptable verification.

Current live CLI success for the fixtures ends with **exit 3 / incomplete**, 6 provider checks, 6 cleanup checks and 27 pending product requirements. The dispatch final gate therefore remains red until that join is integrated and verified. This is a stated integration gap, not an alternate product execution path. Commercial/retention/signoff rows do not become approved through an AWS run.

## Before any live run, after the owner's DEC-CLOUD decision

1. Use a new disposable commercial AWS account with no customer/production resources. Approve account, region, availability zones, monthly alarm budget, per-run USD ceiling and provisional regional cost assumptions. The harness cannot approve these decisions.
2. Apply `deploy/live-sandbox/aws/main.tf` as the accountable account owner, never through the live acceptance role. It creates GitHub OIDC trust, a one-hour execution role with an action-ceiling boundary and scoped identity policy, a deny-all Lambda workload boundary, `/zenith/live-sandbox=true`, a monthly budget alarm and two private DB subnets with a security group permitting no ingress. There is no NAT, EKS, ALB or paid VPC endpoint in the lean fixture profile.
3. Configure GitHub's `live-sandbox` environment with required reviewers, prevent self-review, and restrict deployment branches to protected branches/an explicit allowlist. The trust subject is exactly `repo:<github_repository>:environment:live-sandbox`, where `github_repository` is the `owner/name` that runs live acceptance (currently the fork `saivedant169/zenith`), audience `sts.amazonaws.com`. Repositories with GitHub's immutable OIDC subjects enabled send `repo:<owner>@<owner_id>/<name>@<repo_id>:environment:live-sandbox` instead; check with `gh api repos/<owner>/<name>/actions/oidc/customization/sub` and set `github_oidc_subject_prefix` to its `sub_claim_prefix` value. The fork uses immutable subjects (`repo:saivedant169@88630924/zenith@1417385376`), and the sandbox role was updated to it on 2026-10-24 after the first OIDC exchange was refused with "Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity". These protections are external GitHub settings; YAML alone cannot enforce them. See [AWS's GitHub OIDC guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/hi_in/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html).

   **Owner exception (2026-10-24).** The `live-sandbox` environment on `saivedant169/zenith` has one required reviewer, the owner `saivedant169`, and "prevent self-review" is OFF.
   This is an owner-approved exception to the two-person rule in the `live-acceptance.yml` header and in step 3 above, because the owner decided no second person is needed for this disposable sandbox.
   Accepted residual risk: one compromised owner GitHub account (for example, a leaked `gh` token) could both dispatch and approve a run and obtain the sandbox role.
   Mitigations still in place: disposable sandbox account 361646636162 (ap-south-1), role permissions boundary, one-hour session, tag-scoped mutations, a per-run owner-approved `awsLive` envelope bound to plan digest and source commit, approved root scope, and a $10 monthly budget alert (alert only; it does not stop spend).
   Deployment branches are limited to protected branches, and `codex/production-2026-10-02` requires PRs with 0 approvals (admins included), no force pushes and no deletion.
4. Set environment variables `LIVE_SANDBOX_AWS_ROLE_ARN`, `LIVE_SANDBOX_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `LIVE_SANDBOX_AWS_REGION`, `LIVE_SANDBOX_AWS_DB_SUBNET_GROUP`, `LIVE_SANDBOX_AWS_DB_SECURITY_GROUP`. Use bootstrap outputs; the role name is `ZenithLiveAcceptance`.
5. Freeze and commit the integrated source. Generate the exact plan below with a fresh run ID and bootstrap outputs. Store its approved `permissionsProposal` in an external `permissions.json`, filling `approvedBy`, `approvedAt`, `expiresAt`, `sourceCommit` (that exact clean candidate SHA), budget and duration. Leave all unrelated Wave 5 root permission fields intact. The additive `awsLive` schema is defined in `contracts.ts`; the example is deliberately unapproved. Set protected environment variable `LIVE_SANDBOX_AWS_PERMISSIONS_JSON` to this approved non-secret document for a dispatch. Do not commit a permission's own source SHA into the source it hashes.

Integration with the assembled Wave 5 root scope: approve a separate copy of the strict root manifest using `scripts/release/permissions-cli.ts approve`, and supply its absolute path as `ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE`. Keep `awsLive` in the separate file named by `ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_PERMISSIONS`; adding it to the root document would invalidate the root schema and approval digest. Both approvals must permit the same run, AWS actions, TTL and cost ceiling. The production CLI and pre-OIDC preflight enforce both envelopes before credentials are resolved. Store the approved root JSON in the protected environment variable `LIVE_SANDBOX_SCOPE_JSON` for dispatch. Owned teardown requires a root approval whose approver and content digest still match; it may use the original root approval after that approval lapses, but creation always requires a current one. An expired AWS envelope alone cannot bypass root approval.

## Exact commands on the Mac

Node must be 22; OpenTofu must be 1.12.5. Export `ZENITH_NODE22_BIN` to the verifier's actual Node 22 directory. No Docker is needed for the provider fixtures. Use one workload at a time on the 8GB ARM64 Mac; when verifying the Wave 5 product stack, use its reduced-resource profile and keep Docker at 4GiB. Do not start a second PostgreSQL/Temporal/kind stack for these fixtures.

```bash
export PATH="$ZENITH_NODE22_BIN:$PATH"
node --version
actionlint .github/workflows/live-acceptance.yml
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws init -backend=false
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws fmt -check
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws validate
npx vitest run tests/acceptance/aws-production.test.ts tests/ci/release-gates.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
```

`init` downloads the pinned AWS provider; `validate` and `fmt` do not authorize a cloud plan/apply. Preserve the resulting provider lockfile for integration review. This builder could not execute the installed OpenTofu binary (Windows access denied); syntax/provider validation is unperformed. No bootstrap application is claimed.

After DEC-CLOUD, owner-only bootstrap, with the values approved in that decision:

```bash
export PATH="$ZENITH_NODE22_BIN:$PATH"
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws plan \
  -var="account_id=$AWS_SANDBOX_ACCOUNT_ID" -var="region=$AWS_SANDBOX_REGION" \
  -var="budget_usd=$AWS_SANDBOX_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD" -var="alert_email=$AWS_SANDBOX_ALERT_EMAIL" \
  -var="availability_zones=$AWS_SANDBOX_AZS_JSON" -var='dec_cloud_approved=true' \
  -out=approved-bootstrap.tfplan
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws apply approved-bootstrap.tfplan
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws output
```

Then generate a **credential-free** exact plan (use a fresh valid UTC run ID):

```bash
export PATH="$ZENITH_NODE22_BIN:$PATH"
npx tsx scripts/acceptance/aws-live.ts --plan \
  --account "$AWS_SANDBOX_ACCOUNT_ID" --region "$AWS_SANDBOX_REGION" \
  --run-id "$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_RUN_ID" --minutes 15 \
  --db-subnet-group "$AWS_SANDBOX_DB_SUBNET_GROUP" \
  --db-security-group "$AWS_SANDBOX_DB_SECURITY_GROUP" --scenario fixtures --out "$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_PLAN_DIR"
```

Inspect `plan.json`, approve the exact plan hash/calls/cost/clean source, then either dispatch the workflow or invoke the CLI once:

```bash
export PATH="$ZENITH_NODE22_BIN:$PATH"
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS=1 \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="$AWS_SANDBOX_ACCOUNT_ID" \
ZENITH_LIVE_REGION="$AWS_SANDBOX_REGION" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_RUN_ID="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_RUN_ID" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_SCENARIO="fixtures" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_DB_SUBNET_GROUP="$AWS_SANDBOX_DB_SUBNET_GROUP" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_DB_SECURITY_GROUP="$AWS_SANDBOX_DB_SECURITY_GROUP" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_BUDGET_USD="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_BUDGET_USD" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_PERMISSIONS="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_PERMISSIONS_FILE" \
ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_SCOPE_FILE" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_SESSION_FILE="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_SESSION_FILE" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_OUT="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE_DIR" \
npx tsx scripts/acceptance/aws-live.ts
```

The session FILE is an owner-issued **short-lived** JSON session with `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, `sessionToken`, and `expiration` with 46..60 minutes remaining to cover execution plus cleanup; provide only its absolute path. Never place its contents in code, commands, logs or evidence. Local environment credentials, profiles, IMDS, credential processes and endpoint overrides cannot supply a fallback. GitHub dispatch uses the pinned official OIDC action and its protected environment's one-hour session; no stored access key is configured.

Equivalent dispatch after external environment approval:

```bash
gh workflow run live-acceptance.yml --ref "$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_APPROVED_REF" \
  -f run_id="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_RUN_ID" -f budget_usd="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_BUDGET_USD" \
  -f scenario=fixtures
```

The dispatch `scenario` input is `fixtures` (default), `retention-s3` (PROD-OPS-07, S3 retention archive; scope and cost are in the signed envelope, and the envelope preflight refuses a mismatch), `rel-04` (below) or `mix-03` (the planner must know the scenario, or preflight refuses it as unknown; it is added by its own change). For `retention-s3` and `mix-03` the job starts the lean Zenith stack on the hosted runner **before** the OIDC step, with the same profile and host environment as `operated-gate-linux.yml`, and exports `ZENITH_LIVE_PRODUCT=1`, `ZENITH_LIVE_PRODUCT_DIR`, `ZENITH_LIVE_PRODUCT_DATABASE_URL` (the stack's platform database URL) and `ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_SCENARIO` to the harness. No AWS credential exists during stack start-up. The stack is torn down with `if: always()` before the final gate; a teardown failure is a visible warning and does not change the acceptance outcome. The job timeout is 90 minutes so stack start-up does not eat the one-hour AWS session. The fixtures path is unchanged and starts no stack.

Scenario `rel-04` (PROD-REL-04, S3 only, no stack) runs the crash-and-resume drill instead of the plain harness: `gh workflow run live-acceptance.yml --ref "$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_APPROVED_REF" -f run_id="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_RUN_ID" -f budget_usd="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_BUDGET_USD" -f scenario=rel-04`. A new run id is required for each drill: the account-side run claim is never overwritten. Off-line, the same drill runs as `npx tsx scripts/acceptance/live/drill/rel-04.ts` with the same environment as the harness and an absolute `ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_OUT`; the verifier `npx tsx scripts/acceptance/live/drill/verify-rel-04.ts --run-id <id> --out <same OUT> --permissions <file>` re-checks the receipt without AWS. An always-run `rel-04` recovery closes any still-open drill journal (D1 or its replay D2) with the same `--cleanup` command as the fixtures recovery, whatever the drill did. The final gate for `rel-04` requires the drill, the verifier and that recovery to pass. Details, limits and what it does not prove: [verify/PROD-REL-04.md](verify/PROD-REL-04.md#live-drill-scenario-rel-04).

The full fixture test is separate, real and gated. It expects exit 3/incomplete for this source, then independently inspects 6 actual fixture checks, 6 teardown checks, zero failed checks and 27 pending product rows. It cannot certify those product rows. Do not run both CLI and test for the same run ID:

```bash
export PATH="$ZENITH_NODE22_BIN:$PATH"
# With all live variables above exported for a NEW approved run:
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS=1 npx vitest run tests/acceptance/aws-production.live.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
```

Without the flag this test is skipped, never live evidence. With the flag and missing prerequisites it fails. The separate existing IAM boundary-family acceptance remains the LIFE-03 check; use the exact gated commands in `verify/PROD-LIFE-03.md`. This fixture role is not a replacement for Zenith's deploy role.

## Owner decision (2026-10-26): delegated run approval

- **Decision.** Live AWS sandbox runs no longer need the owner's per-run signature or a GitHub deployment click. The `live-sandbox` environment's required reviewer was removed; the protected-branch deployment-branch policy is kept. This supersedes the reviewer gate described in the 2026-10-24 owner exception above. The workflow header comment (lines 19-22) still describes the reviewer requirement and is out of date until the environment setting changes.
- **Still binding for every run.** The automated envelope binds the exact plan digest, source commit, account, region, USD cap and duration. The root `permissions.json` approval (valid until 2026-11-23) and the $100 total still apply. Automation stops and reports at $5 cumulative automated caps.
- **Run that used it.** `zlive-202610252113-f271` (run 40234506190, scenario `retention-s3`), `approvedBy` "automation (delegated by Saivedant Hava on 2026-10-26)". See [verify/PROD-OPS-07.md](verify/PROD-OPS-07.md).
- **Run time limit: `minutes` input.** The dispatch input `minutes` (string, default `15`, integer 5 to 20, the range `scripts/acceptance/live/plan.ts` enforces) is checked in the pre-OIDC step "Check the sandbox account configuration" and exported as `ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_MINUTES` at job level, so preflight, the harness, the rel-04 drill and recovery all build the same plan. Dispatch with the value the owner approved: `-f minutes=<n>`. The signed envelope binds the plan digest, so a plan for 20 minutes dispatched with the default 15 is refused with "Permission is not bound to this exact plan".
- **How to undo.** In GitHub, Settings > Environments > `live-sandbox`: add `saivedant169` back as a required reviewer, and turn on "Prevent self-review" if the two-person rule is restored. Then set the envelope `approvedBy` to a human approval again. This gate is an external GitHub setting, so no code change is needed to restore it.

## PROD-MIX-02 in the mix-03 run (2026-10-30)

The `mix-03` scenario's scope is PROD-MIX-03 and PROD-MIX-02. One run answers both: `scripts/acceptance/live/product/mix-03.ts` runs the flow once and the harness asks for each requirement in ledger order. The plan's AWS calls are unchanged. PROD-MIX-02 adds no AWS write; it reads the stored parent plan through `GET /api/platform/v1/mixed/plans/:id` and re-lists the producer bucket by tag.

1. After the proposal, the port reads the stored plan: exactly two children, the consumer depends on exactly the producer, and the execution order runs the producer first.
2. When the producer has succeeded and the consumer waits for an approval, the port reads the plan and the producer bucket, then stops the stack's `execution-worker` container. It approves while the worker is down, waits 30 s, then starts the worker and waits until it is healthy. The parent can only go on by resuming.
3. At the end it reads the plan again. The parent, desired and child-set digests, each child's subplan, semantics and effect digests and every stable address must equal the first readback. Both receipts must link their child operation, bind the semantics the child ran and re-derive from their own fields (`receiptDigestOf`). The producer's receipt must equal the one read before the stop. AWS must hold the same one producer bucket.

A PROD-MIX-02 refusal at the final readback leaves the PROD-MIX-03 result as it is. A failure before that, a worker that does not come back, or a cleanup leak fails both. Leaks are reported once, on PROD-MIX-03.

## MIX-03 connection and spend stop (2026-10-26)

Owner decision 2026-10-26. Live runs connect Zenith to sandbox 361646636162 (ap-south-1) through the customer bootstrap `deploy/aws/zenith-connection.cfn.yaml`, installed once as stack `zenith-connection-live`. `deploy/live-sandbox/aws/main.tf` adds the `connection_name_suffix` variable (default `-live`), the connection roles `ZenithObserveRole-live` and `ZenithDeployRole-live`, and an automatic spend stop. Nothing in this change applies Terraform or touches AWS; the owner applies it later.

**One-time install (owner, CloudShell or root, account 361646636162).** The template is about 116 KB, above the inline `--template-body` limit, so stage it through a temporary bucket and delete that bucket after install:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://zenith-cfn-stage-361646636162 --region ap-south-1
aws s3 cp deploy/aws/zenith-connection.cfn.yaml s3://zenith-cfn-stage-361646636162/zenith-connection.cfn.yaml
aws cloudformation create-stack --region ap-south-1 --stack-name zenith-connection-live \
  --template-url https://zenith-cfn-stage-361646636162.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zenith-connection.cfn.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameters ParameterKey=NameSuffix,ParameterValue=-live \
    ParameterKey=ZenithPrincipalArn,ParameterValue=arn:aws:iam::361646636162:role/ZenithLiveAcceptance \
    ParameterKey=ExternalId,ParameterValue=placeholder-set-per-run \
    ParameterKey=EnvironmentTagValue,ParameterValue='*'
aws cloudformation wait stack-create-complete --region ap-south-1 --stack-name zenith-connection-live
aws s3 rb s3://zenith-cfn-stage-361646636162 --force
```

Install the stack before `tofu apply`: the budget action names both connection roles, and that path was not checked against a live account. `ExternalId` is a placeholder here; the per-run value replaces it.

**Per-run ExternalId (Option A).** Each live run, the test role `ZenithLiveAcceptance` calls `iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy` on `ZenithObserveRole-live` and `ZenithDeployRole-live` to write the ExternalId that Zenith generated for that connection, then calls `sts:AssumeRole` on both (with `sts:TagSession`). `iam:GetRole` reads the trust policy first. These are the only roles it can assume or rewrite.

**Residual risk.** AWS cannot constrain the content of a trust document through IAM conditions here, so the test role could write any principal into either trust policy. The compensating control is the automatic spend stop below. It is not a hard cap: Budgets acts on ACTUAL cost, which lags, and the stop blocks new API calls but does not stop resources already running.

**Spend stop.** `aws_budgets_budget_action.spend_stop` (APPLY_IAM_POLICY, AUTOMATIC, ACTUAL, 100% of the existing $10 `budget_usd`) attaches `ZenithLiveSpendStopDenyAll` (Deny `*` on `*`) to `ZenithLiveAcceptance`, `ZenithDeployRole-live` and `ZenithObserveRole-live`. Budgets assumes `ZenithLiveSpendStopExecution`, which can attach or detach only that policy on those three roles.

**After the stop fires.** The runner and cleanup are blocked too, so leftover resources must be checked by hand:

1. Read the cause in the Budgets console (budget `zenith-live-sandbox`, Actions) and list the policy's attachments: `aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::361646636162:policy/ZenithLiveSpendStopDenyAll`.
2. Inventory resources tagged `zenith:managed=true` and `zenith:live-run` and delete leftovers with the owner's admin access.
3. Detach the deny policy from all three roles: `aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name <role> --policy-arn <arn>` for `ZenithLiveAcceptance`, `ZenithDeployRole-live` and `ZenithObserveRole-live`. The bootstrap operator policy does not allow this, by design.
4. Do not start another run until the budget action status is checked. Whether it fires again while spend stays above 100% in the same month is not verified.

**Run cleanup scope (owner decision 2026-10-26, delegated).** `ZenithLiveAcceptance` may delete only what a PROD-MIX-03 run created, in `deploy/live-sandbox/aws/main.tf` `locals.statements` (statements `MixCleanup*`):

- Lambda `zenith-*` functions: `GetFunctionConfiguration` and `DeleteFunction`, only when `zenith:managed=true`.
- Log groups `/aws/lambda/zenith-*`: `DeleteLogGroup`. Name-only: Lambda does not copy function tags to its log groups, so a tag condition cannot match.
- IAM roles `zenith-*`: `GetRole`, `ListAttachedRolePolicies`, `ListRolePolicies`, `DeleteRolePolicy`, `DeleteRole`, only when `zenith:managed=true`. `DetachRolePolicy` is also limited to `policy/zenith-*` through `iam:PolicyARN`.
- S3 buckets `zenith-*`: `ListBucket`, `GetBucketTagging`, `DeleteBucket`. Name-only, because a bucket tag condition for `DeleteBucket` is not confirmed (it may need per-bucket ABAC). The MIX-03 teardown checks `zenith:managed` and `zenith:environment` on each bucket before deleting it.
- `tag:GetResources` is reused from `UnscopableInventory`; no new statement.

Explicit denies override these allows: `s3:DeleteBucket` and `s3:DeleteObject` on `zenith-state-*`, and `iam` delete or detach on the connection roles (`ZenithObserveRole-live`, `ZenithDeployRole-live`, `ZenithSecretWriterRole-live`, `zenith-codebuild-live`) and the connection managed policies (`Zenith*-live`). `zenith-codebuild-live` is lower-case, so the `zenith-*` role pattern would match it; the deny is what protects it. IAM ARN matching is case-sensitive, so the capitalised bootstrap and connection roles are outside `zenith-*`.

Sizes: the inline role policy is 9948 of 10240 characters (was 8078). The runner boundary `ZenithLiveRunnerBoundary` is 1508 characters (managed-policy limit 6144). The boundary now lists only actions from `Allow` statements.

**Residual:** log-group and bucket deletes are name-scoped. Any `zenith-*` log group or bucket that the role can name can be deleted, even one that is not from a MIX-03 run. The MIX-03 code limits what it actually deletes. Nothing here is applied; the owner applies `main.tf` with `tofu apply`.

**Retention.** The stack's state bucket (`zenith-state-361646636162-ap-south-1-live`) has `DeletionPolicy: Retain`. Deleting `zenith-connection-live` leaves it in place; empty and delete it yourself when you no longer need it.

## Second sandbox lane (2026-10-29)

Owner decision 2026-10-29: two live runs may run at once, one per lane, so the AWS private-beta proofs finish faster.

- **Lanes.** `live` uses connection stack `zenith-connection-live` (roles `ZenithObserveRole-live`, `ZenithDeployRole-live`, state bucket `zenith-state-361646636162-ap-south-1-live`). `live2` uses `zenith-connection-live2` with the same names ending in `-live2`. The plan binds the lane (`settings.lane`, absent for `live`, so earlier digests are unchanged).
- **Isolation.** Each lane has its own concurrency group (`live-acceptance-<lane>`), its own envelope variables (`LIVE_SANDBOX_AWS_PERMISSIONS_JSON` and `LIVE_SANDBOX_SCOPE_JSON`, with suffix `_LIVE2` for `live2`), and its own connection roles, whose trust each run rewrites. Both lanes share the acceptance role, the spend stop, the DB network and the account.
- **Product scenarios only on `live2`.** The plan refuses `fixtures`, `retention-s3` and `rel-04` on `live2`. Those create resources tagged `zenith:purpose=live-acceptance`, which the other lane's leak preflight would count as a prior leak.
- **IAM.** `deploy/live-sandbox/aws/main.tf` matches the connection roles with one pattern per role (`ZenithObserveRole-live*`, `ZenithDeployRole-live*`, also in the delete denies). The inline policy limit is 10240 characters; it goes from 9948 to 9957. The spend stop names every lane role exactly (`connection_lane_suffixes`). Residual: the acceptance role may assume or rewrite the trust of any role whose name starts with `ZenithObserveRole-live` or `ZenithDeployRole-live`. Only the owner can create such roles.

**One-time install (owner).** First, in CloudShell for account 361646636162, upload `deploy/aws/zenith-connection.cfn.yaml` (Actions > Upload file), then run:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://zenith-cfn-stage-361646636162 --region ap-south-1
aws s3 cp zenith-connection.cfn.yaml s3://zenith-cfn-stage-361646636162/zenith-connection.cfn.yaml
aws cloudformation create-stack --region ap-south-1 --stack-name zenith-connection-live2 \
  --template-url https://zenith-cfn-stage-361646636162.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zenith-connection.cfn.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameters ParameterKey=NameSuffix,ParameterValue=-live2 \
    ParameterKey=ZenithPrincipalArn,ParameterValue=arn:aws:iam::361646636162:role/ZenithLiveAcceptance \
    ParameterKey=ExternalId,ParameterValue=placeholder-set-per-run \
    ParameterKey=EnvironmentTagValue,ParameterValue='*'
aws cloudformation wait stack-create-complete --region ap-south-1 --stack-name zenith-connection-live2
aws s3 rb s3://zenith-cfn-stage-361646636162 --force
```

The stack holds IAM roles and policies and an empty state bucket, so it costs nothing at rest. Then apply `main.tf` where its state lives, with `connection_lane_suffixes = ["-live", "-live2"]`. The expected plan is 0 to add, 3 to change and 0 to destroy: `aws_iam_role_policy.runner`, `aws_iam_role_policy.spend_stop` and `aws_budgets_budget_action.spend_stop`. Install the stack first: the budget action names the `-live2` roles.

**To undo.** Set `connection_lane_suffixes = ["-live"]`, apply, then delete the stack. Its state bucket has `DeletionPolicy: Retain`; empty and delete it yourself.

## OPS-06 secret persistence run (2026-10-29)

Scenario `ops-06` (either lane, 5 to 60 minutes) proves PROD-OPS-06 on AWS. It reuses the DEPLOY-01 sandbox calls and adds the lane's `ZenithSecretWriterRole`. The product writes service secrets to Secrets Manager only through that role, so the run points its trust at the run's ExternalId and restores it afterwards, as it does for the observe and deploy roles.

1. Create the connection with `secretWriterRoleArn` (accepted by `connection.createAws` since this change).
2. Set `ZENITH_OPS06_CANARY` on the `web` service through `system.setSecret`, with a random canary that exists only in the harness's memory.
3. Deploy once, then read back the ALB over HTTP.
4. Check the recorded OpenTofu state: the task definition must read the key from a `zenith/` Secrets Manager secret, and no copy of the value may appear anywhere in the state.
5. Scan the runner for the raw canary bytes with `sudo grep`: Docker's data root (container logs, volumes including PostgreSQL files and WAL, container writes), the runner temp and the checkout. A control file must be found; any other hit fails the run.
6. Destroy the recorded state.

The scan does not cover process memory, the browser profile, or AWS-side copies (CloudWatch, CloudTrail).

**IAM.** `main.tf` adds `ZenithSecretWriterRole-live*` to the connection role patterns: the inline policy goes from 9957 to 10081 of 10240 characters. Apply as before; the plan is 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy (`aws_iam_role_policy.runner`).

## OPS-04 control-plane restore run (2026-10-29)

Scenario `ops-04` (either lane, 5 to 60 minutes) proves PROD-OPS-04 and PROD-OPS-01 in one run, with real AWS customer state. It uses the TEARDOWN-01 sandbox calls; Zenith deploys at most two S3 buckets.

1. Deploy one bucket.
2. Propose a second bucket and let the worker plan it, so the deploy waits for its apply approval. Then stop the worker. A deploy that is already dispatched (`running`) restores `uncertain` and can never be resumed, so the plan review is the one resumable point.
3. Back up with the product's recovery library. The backup must include every component and verify.
4. Start the worker, then approve and apply. AWS and the recorded state now hold the second bucket, which the backup does not know about.
5. Loss: stop the API and worker. Restore the backup into a new database in the stack's PostgreSQL, terminating open Temporal workflows. The report must be `ok` with a higher recovery epoch.
6. Check the fence: the restored deploy waits at its plan review, stamped with the old epoch. Recreate the API against the restored database; an approval of that deploy must be refused. Then start the worker.
7. For 2 minutes the operation must not run on its own, and AWS and the recorded state must stay the same.
8. The recovery API must list the operation as resumable. A stale binding must be refused with 409; the right binding resumes it into a fresh approval.
9. Approve again. The apply must leave AWS unchanged: the same buckets and the same number of recorded resources.
10. Measure RPO and RTO against the approved targets: 900 s and 14400 s (`deploy/slo/slo-definitions.json`).
11. PROD-OPS-01 (`ops01-measure.ts`), against the targets in `deploy/slo/slo-definitions.json`:
    - Availability and latency: from step 1 to the end, the runner probes the API readiness route (`/api/me`) every 100 ms. Probing pauses only for the loss in step 5, which RTO measures instead. Availability counts every answer that is not a 5xx; no answer is a failure. Both ratios must be demonstrated by the 95% one-sided lower bound. The run keeps probing until there are enough samples for that (at least 2995 for 0.999).
    - Capacity: a 60 s open-loop burst at 30 requests/s. Only 2xx answers count as served.
    - RPO and RTO: from the restore in step 5.
    - Objectives with no source in this run are listed as not evaluated: managed runtime availability, dispatch latency, workflow completion and scheduler health.

Runner tools: the workflow installs `postgresql-client-17` and the pinned Temporal CLI 1.9.1 for this scenario only.

**Not covered (named residuals).** The restore target is a new database on the same stack host, so the keys are already present. A restore onto a different host needs the keys from the operator's secret manager. `up.mjs` cannot take an escrowed keyring yet. The backup does not include Supabase `auth` (user accounts); in production that store is the Supabase project's own backup.

## OPS-05 key rotation run (2026-10-30)

Scenario `ops-05` (either lane, 5 to 60 minutes) proves PROD-OPS-05 with real AWS customer state. It uses the TEARDOWN-01 sandbox calls; Zenith deploys at most two S3 buckets.

1. Store one vault secret with `system.setSecret` (on a service that is never deployed) and deploy one bucket under the installation's first keys.
2. Read the deploy's Temporal history with the pinned Temporal CLI. `key-custody.ts codec` must show it written under the current Temporal key only.
3. Rotate every generated key with `node scripts/deploy/installation.mjs rotate <installation>`, then remove and recreate the API and worker together.
4. `key-custody.ts sync` and `diagnose --json`: every rotated purpose has a new current key and keeps the old one decrypt-only (vault, Temporal, plan artifacts, results, machine results) or verify-only (control and OIDC signing); no error finding; Temporal and results no longer share a root.
5. The AWS connection still verifies. `codec --verify` on the first history: every encrypted payload needs the now decrypt-only key and decrypts.
6. Deploy a second bucket under the new keys; its history uses only the new Temporal key.
7. `rewrap --workspace <id> --run`, then `rewrap-status` until the job completes with at least one secret re-sealed.

No operator output may contain any key value, old or new (plain keys, previous-key lists and private JWK members are scanned).

Runner tools: the workflow installs the pinned Temporal CLI 1.9.1 (and the PostgreSQL 17 client) for ops-04 and ops-05.

**Not covered (named residuals).** KMS-held signing keys, the backup key (no decrypt-only list in this build), agent-link and invite sealing (no overlap by design), and retiring the old keys after the history window.

## OPS-03 rolling upgrade run (2026-10-31)

Scenario `ops-03` (either lane, 5 to 60 minutes) proves PROD-OPS-03 on the runner's stack with a real AWS deploy in flight. It uses the TEARDOWN-01 sandbox calls; Zenith deploys at most two S3 buckets. Code: `scripts/acceptance/live/product/ops-03.ts` and `ops-03-stack.ts`.

1. Build candidate API, worker and migration images from this source with distinct rehearsal labels and push them to the stack's own registry (`default-stack/upgrade-candidates.mjs`, as DRV-3).
2. Deploy one bucket: approve the proposal, then wait for the plan review. The deploy's Temporal workflow is running and nothing exists in AWS yet.
3. Upgrade in the order `scripts/ops/rolling-upgrade.mjs` prints: `platform-migrate --dry-run`, the expand migration, the worker, then the API, each healthy on its new image.
4. The review is unchanged (same status and round), the same Temporal run is still running, and AWS is still empty.
5. Approve the apply on the candidate release. The same run completes and AWS holds one tagged bucket.
6. Roll back: the API, then the worker, onto the recorded images. The schema is not downgraded.
7. Deploy a second bucket on the rolled-back release. AWS holds two tagged buckets.

**Not covered (named residuals).** The candidates are rebuilt from the same source, because no released N-1 exists yet: this proves in-flight replacement and rollback against AWS, not a previous-release compatibility matrix. Runner (machine) upgrades are separate.

## OPS-02 fairness and outage run (2026-10-31)

Scenario `ops-02` (either lane, 5 to 60 minutes) proves PROD-OPS-02 with ready-made parts: the repository's pinned Prometheus image and its own alert and dashboard definitions (`deploy/observability`), and the DEPLOY-01 nginx service on ECS Fargate behind an ALB. It uses the DEPLOY-01 sandbox calls and cost ceiling. Code: the `ops-02` branch of `scripts/acceptance/live/product/deploy-01.ts` and `ops-02-stack.ts`.

1. Recreate the API with a run-scoped `CRON_SECRET` (the lean stack sets none) and start Prometheus on the host network, scraping `/api/internal/metrics` over the stack's TLS every 5 s with both rule files loaded.
2. A second tenant is created. The first sends 600 requests, 40 at a time; the second sends 20, 2 at a time, during the flood. The first must be refused (HTTP 429) and the second fully served.
3. The dashboard's tenant-filtered refusal panel, queried in Prometheus, shows refusals for the first tenant and none for the second.
4. Deploy the DEPLOY-01 service and probe the ALB once a second from here on.
5. Stop the control store (the Supabase database container) until `ZenithControlStoreDown` fires, then also stop the API and worker for 60 s. Every probe must be HTTP 200.
6. Restart the control store, API and worker; the store reports up and the tenant is served again.

**Not covered (named residuals).** Traces in a trace backend, worker-side metrics (the worker's endpoint is loopback-only), the Grafana UI import (proven locally by `import-harness.mjs`), and Temporal-backed worker fairness.

## Budget, cleanup and evidence limits

The hard admission ceiling reserves the canonical fixed topology, maximum attempts, a 5..20 minute execution window and a 2USD cleanup reserve before **any** AWS call. It refuses an altered self-consistent cost/topology as well as unknown/unplanned calls, changed inputs, missing per-call permission, exhausted attempt counts and expired mutation permission. Before billable creation it atomically claims `/zenith/live-runs/<runId>` using Standard-tier PutParameter with Overwrite=false and independently reads it. This account-side receipt prevents replay from a new directory or another machine. The execution role cannot overwrite/delete the receipt. The bootstrap uses the documented StringEquals condition for ssm:Overwrite; see [AWS Parameter Store condition guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-policy-conditions.html). Non-billing receipts are intentionally retained for replay prevention, tagged with purpose live-acceptance-receipt, and excluded from workload leak discovery; deletion requires a separate accountable retention decision. Cleanup is limited to already approved teardown/read inventory, can use the original approval after its expiry, and has a 25-minute observation deadline. It cannot create new resources or claim another run in recovery mode. SDK retries are disabled; every attempt is counted and journaled before dispatch.

The 6.45USD default estimate is a conservative **provisional allowance**, not a price quotation or billing measurement. The owner must validate rates before approving it. Budget alarms are delayed billing notifications, not an account spend kill switch. AWS acknowledges billing/notification delay in [its budget guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html). No system can guarantee a dollar cap or successful teardown if AWS/runner/storage is unavailable. If a truly unconditional account cap or teardown guarantee is an acceptance requirement, this lane must remain blocked on that owner decision rather than claiming one.

Every resource is named by run ID and carries `zenith:live-run`, `zenith:managed`, `zenith:purpose`. Before mutation the harness checks caller account and exact execution role, the sandbox opt-in marker, private bootstrap DB network, old tagged leaks and native presence of every planned name. Before deletion it checks all three ownership tags, deletes dependents before their prerequisites and polls each provider's native absence. A Lambda deletion failure blocks IAM role deletion. Access denied, malformed state, exhausted counters and timeouts are never interpreted as absence.

S3 and Route53 cannot both create and tag atomically in these APIs. Each create records an intent marker in the journal before its request (the S3 bucket name, or the Route53 record put). If a crash leaves a created resource untagged, cleanup re-applies that run's planned tag once (`s3-tag` or `dns-tag`; two planned attempts in total) and then runs the normal ownership proof and teardown. This happens only when the journal proves this run's create and the untagged state is exact (S3 `NoSuchTagSet`, Route53 empty tag list). Tags that differ, or a create the journal never recorded, are still refused: the harness deletes nothing, reports a leak, and an owner must resolve that positively identified orphan. Recovery never calls a create operation. Route53 creation and zone tagging/deletion cannot be restricted by resource tags in IAM: [the service authorization reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_route53.html) documents its supported resource conditions. That account-level permission is confined to this disposable account; record mutations only allow reserved TXT names. Never use this role in an account containing unrelated DNS zones. The role cannot edit its own policies, mint access keys, fetch secret values or remove its boundaries.

The RDS-managed credential is never retrieved; [RDS deletes its managed secret with the DB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html). The harness persists only its scoped ARN and independently checks secret absence using DescribeSecret, never GetSecretValue. ECS/RDS service-linked roles and bootstrap network/marker/policies/budget remain account bootstrap objects, not per-run leaks. The bootstrap owner precreates those service-linked roles (or proves both already exist and sets create_service_linked_roles=false); the runner cannot create them. The owner removes bootstrap infrastructure separately after all per-run resources are absent. No production data, snapshot or retention policy is deleted by this harness.

`finally` attempts teardown on partial failure, SIGINT and SIGTERM. Workflow recovery continues after a failed harness step, uploads the sanitized journal/packet, then a final hard gate checks both original acceptance and recovery outcomes. Runner loss, forced cancellation or a hard job timeout cannot execute an in-process finalizer. Download the journal and resume the exact approved source manually; no unattended-work or guaranteed-cloud-cleanup claim is made:

```bash
export PATH="$ZENITH_NODE22_BIN:$PATH"
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS=1 ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_BUDGET_USD="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_BUDGET_USD" \
ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_SCOPE_FILE" \
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_SESSION_FILE="$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_SESSION_FILE" \
npx tsx scripts/acceptance/aws-live.ts --permissions "$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_PERMISSIONS_FILE" \
  --cleanup "$AWS_ACCEPTANCE_JOURNAL_FILE"
```

Cleanup preserves counters, plan/permission/source bindings and earlier failures. Exhausted counters require a newly reviewed recovery envelope; they cannot be reset by rerunning. A closed journal requires no calls. Each run writes `next-command.txt` and `checkpoint.json` into its run directory before the first AWS call and refreshes both on every journal save, so a killed process still leaves a runnable cleanup command on disk. The command sets `ZENITH_LIVE_AWS=1`, `ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_BUDGET_USD`, `ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE` and `ZENITH_LIVE_AWS_SESSION_FILE` and single-quotes every path; the session FILE must be re-issued for each resume. The checkpoint (the same store format as the mixed live run) records the bound decisions (plan, permission and commit digests, budget, scenario, approval label), the next command and `unattendedClaims: false`; its step is `done` only when the journal closes. Atomic `journal.json` stores only intended families, bounded counters, a DNS resource identity and scoped managed-secret ARN, never raw AWS responses, secret values, tokens or plan state. `evidence.json` contains timestamps, source commit, plan/permission hashes, check scopes, cleanup result, visible pending rows and no false release promotion. Only the actual SDK transport can set live provenance; modeled transports cannot emit live requirement evidence even when a check claims success. Only complete independently verified product checks can produce ledger-shaped `live_sandbox` entries; fixture-only checks never do. The packet hash allows reviewers to bind the sanitized evidence artifact.

## Shared owner procedure, final integration

All L1/L2/L3 commands use one absolute `ZENITH_LIVE_BUDGET_FILE` below the owner private directory. Reservations are locked, cumulative across providers and never automatically refunded. A repeated run id is refused; use the cleanup-only command after interruption. Existing exact scope, permission, inventory and ownership gates remain mandatory. Cloud acceptance is deferred; none was executed by final integration.

### Azure, GCP, OCI and DNS live acceptance

Build packet for L2-LIVE-CLOUDS. No cloud, DNS, ACME, browser or paid action was executed on this PC. Offline tests model responses; they are contract evidence only. No requirement or release flag is promoted.

## Azure sandbox (2026-10-25)

- Subscription: Azure for Students, `cacfdf22-d95d-48b8-b245-a6ed8c985a84`, tenant `03cb5f0c-1f82-4993-9621-36330f6309ec`, single region `eastasia`. The subscription policy allows only polandcentral, eastasia, austriaeast, indiasouthcentral and koreacentral.
- App registrations are disallowed in this tenant. That is fine: the bootstrap in `deploy/live-sandbox/azure/main.tf` uses a user-assigned managed identity with a federated credential.
- Set `github_oidc_subject_prefix` to the immutable prefix `repo:saivedant169@88630924/zenith@1417385376`, and set `owner_tag` (the `zenith_owner` tag value; no default).
- Resource providers, registered by the owner on 2026-10-25: Microsoft.ManagedIdentity, Storage, KeyVault, ContainerRegistry, Network, Consumption, DBforPostgreSQL.
- The bootstrap needs existing blob container, key vault and container registry scopes (`blob_container_scope`, `key_vault_scope`, `registry_scope`). It does not create them.
- The container registry (Basic) bills about USD 5 per month while it exists. Create it just before a run and delete it after.
- Editing `docs/build/production/permissions.json` makes its approval stale until the owner re-approves after merge: `npx tsx scripts/release/permissions-cli.ts approve --by "Saivedant Hava" --days 30`.

## Entry points and authority

`npx tsx scripts/acceptance/live/{azure,gcp,oci}/run.ts` and `npx tsx scripts/acceptance/live/dns/run.ts <provider>` are real entry points. They check Node 22, a clean checkout at the packet's exact commit, provider opt-in and an owner-approved `permissions.json` before opening credential files or making a request. DNS also needs `ZENITH_LIVE_DNS=1`. Missing opt-in exits 3 (NOT RUN); invalid configuration exits 2; failed/incomplete evidence exits 1. Exit 0 means the selected checks and scoped cleanup passed, never that an entire requirement is verified.

The owner supplies a permissions file matching `zenith.live-cloud-permissions.v1`. The example is deliberately unapproved and expired. It binds the parsed packet SHA256, cost/duration ceiling, expiry, exact HTTPS origins/path prefixes, DNS suffixes, retained bootstrap resource IDs and teardown targets. Changing any packet field invalidates approval. Every request and page rechecks permission. No inline token, ambient credential, privileged fallback, shell command or approval API is accepted.

Compose integration also requires the existing root scope approval, supplied through `ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE` as a separate approved root manifest. Its strict schema and approval digest stay unchanged. The `non-aws-dns-live` observer grant must permit the selected provider read, control-plane read and owned teardown; the real destroy path still proves ownership and consumes human approval. Root per-run/per-provider/total budgets and lifetime ceilings apply alongside the exact L2 packet envelope, and root expiry is rechecked for subsequent calls. In particular the shipped OCI budget is zero and every shipped root approval is absent; a person must approve an appropriate envelope before any live campaign.

`--plan --packet <file>` opens only that non-secret packet. It prints scenario coverage, provisional estimate, dependencies and reverse cleanup order, with zero credential reads/network calls. Estimates must include managed DB/cluster minimum billing, egress, latency/residency constraints and orphan contingency; they are supplied by the Wave 5 cost/release packet emitter, not live price discovery. Budget alerts are notifications, not a hard spending cap.

## Operated fixture seam (Wave 5 join, explicit)

This base lacks the Wave 5 release/MAN fixtures. The harness does not reimplement their provisioning, authority, approval, fault injection or managed service code. The small join is `Packet` in `scripts/acceptance/live/dns/contracts.ts`: the release fixture producer emits one provider-scoped packet containing environment IDs in producer-before-consumer order, immutable operation/plan IDs, independent read URLs and exact JSON-pointer assertions. The person still approves fixture execution and destroy in the real browser. Until this packet is emitted from the operated fixture, the live scenarios cannot close acceptance.

Examples contain REPLACE fields and intentionally wrong commit/run IDs. They are plans, not executable proof. Replace every check's assertions with the full clause mapping below; asserting only a status is insufficient. Operations must return a bound terminal ID and environment; mixed plan reads reuse `verifyMixedEvidence`. New fault/materialization scenarios need separate operation receipts and independent readbacks; one happy-path receipt cannot cover failure scenarios.

| Requirement | Mandatory operated scenarios / independent readback |
|---|---|
| LIFE-04 | `azure-source-binding`: immutable source context digest and account/container provenance; `azure-data-plane`: exact scoped roles plus Blob/Key Vault read; `azure-source-build`: ACR run succeeded and image digest read independently; `azure-sovereign`: a separate sovereign-account packet proves its configured authority/ARM hosts. Public Azure does not satisfy sovereign acceptance. |
| LIFE-05 | `oci-runner-replacement`: kill/restart an owned runner inheriting the durable journal, same receipt/request/resource identity; `oci-lost-response`: lost launch stays uncertain, no second launch; `oci-deletion`: absent resource and complete family listing, work request only corroborates; `oci-mysql-refusal`: exact unsafe-secret-sink refusal. Fault injection belongs to the Wave 5/runner fixture, not this observer. |
| LIFE-06 | Per GCP/Azure/OCI: `dns-owned` reads exact record/endpoint tags, value, ownership marker and reviewed proof digest; `dns-foreign` and `dns-unreadable` require explicit ownership refusal (not cancellation/timeout) with no approvable destroy operation. Finally wait for exact human-approved destroy and independent empty record inventory. Foreign records remain unchanged. |
| MIX-01 | `mixed-authorities`: at least two provider/account/region/backend/connection identities independently observed. |
| MIX-02 | `mixed-immutable-plans`: parent approval and immutable child-set/subplan/semantics digests, dependency order, stable addresses, durable receipts, resume. |
| MIX-03 | `mixed-output-scope`: producer provenance, typed output/secret references, changed effect requires new review unless exact preauthorization. Never put secret values in the packet. |
| MIX-04 | `mixed-failure-order`: separate cycle, partial success, timeout, expiry, cancellation, outage, drift, migration and reverse-teardown observations; no automatic destructive compensation. |
| MIX-05 | `mixed-connectivity`: actual protected/private routes, CIDR overlap refusal, DNS/TLS/identity/secret binding, independent firewall/private endpoint readback. Database public exposure is never silently accepted. |
| MIX-06 | `mixed-traffic`: protected fixture endpoint returns the supplied fresh nonce after a DB write/read through actual GCP compute, Azure PostgreSQL and AWS functions, with independent provider/DB readbacks. The AWS job supplies its partition evidence; a renamed local/mock tier is insufficient. |
| MIX-07 | `mixed-recovery-economics`: fixture injects one-provider outage and recovery, independently probes traffic before/after; read measured transfer/latency/residency and catalog economics. |
| MAN-01 | `managed-substrate`: default composition/session opener, owned source build and release, actual managed cluster/provider state and traffic; no injected mock ports. |
| MAN-02 | `managed-serving`: each registry/gateway/DNS/TLS/secret/storage/DB integration has a real readback. |
| MAN-03 | `domain-proof-renewal`: DNS TXT proof plus a renewed certificate on a trusted TLS socket, exact hostname, validity and changed issuer/serial/expiry readback from the operated ACME renewal; `managed-data-catalog`: tenant storage separation, DB export/restore nonce, autoscaling and promised catalog services. |
| REL-01/02/04 | Evidence, budgets, scope, cleanup and checkpoint support only. Complete release journey/dossier/signoff remains the release job's scope. OPS and MAN-04..07 remain with their owners. |

## Credentials and bootstrap

Keep every file outside the checkout, mode 0600, and never upload it as evidence. `ZENITH_LIVE_API_TOKEN_FILE` contains the control-plane integration token. `ZENITH_LIVE_<PROVIDER>_CREDENTIAL_FILE` names a JSON file:

- Azure: `{provider:"azure", account:<subscription>, region:<region>, tokenFiles:{<exact HTTPS origin>:<token FILE path>}}`. Obtain audience-specific short-lived Entra tokens through the approved GitHub environment federation. ARM, Blob, Vault and ACR tokens have separate audiences. Blob XML readback exposes HTTP status/content hash only.
- GCP: `{provider:"gcp", account:<project ID>, region:<region>, accessTokenFile:<short-lived impersonated token FILE>}`.
- OCI: `{provider:"oci", account:<compartment OCID>, region:<region>, securityTokenFile:<short-lived RPST FILE>, privateKeyFile:<ephemeral PoP private-key FILE>}`. Requests use standard OCI RSA-SHA256 signatures. No user API key is accepted.

All three credential references may additionally specify `trafficTokenFiles:{<approved exact HTTPS origin>:<application bearer token FILE>}` for protected fixture traffic. Cloud and control-plane credentials are never reused for application endpoints. Private-network-only endpoints may omit it.

`deploy/live-sandbox/<provider>/main.tf` creates scoped observer trust/roles and 50% actual/80% forecast monthly budget alerts. Observer credentials have no deploy/destroy/IAM management authority; provisioning stays with the existing reviewed Zenith connection and browser policy. All application resources need `zenith_live_run=<run ID>` in Azure tags, GCP labels and OCI freeform tags, alongside existing Zenith workspace/environment ownership metadata. Label/tag creation is a fixture-emitter join; this job does not add tag adoption to production callers.

Azure federation pins the exact repository/protected environment subject. GCP additionally pins numeric owner/repository IDs and ref. OCI uses an IdentityPropagationTrust template with five exact claim validations; the owner must configure the non-admin exchange client or an approved instance-principal caller. Token exchange itself still requires caller authentication; this is not an anonymous GitHub-to-OCI exchange. No admin client fallback. OCI policy condition names and service permissions require actual provider/tenancy admission before use; do not infer it from HCL syntax.

## Inventory, teardown and evidence

Supply complete service-specific inventories of every created family. Azure RG resource lists omit registry images and some child DNS records, so add those inventories. GCP assets can be eventual and do not replace complete Compute/DNS/Storage/Artifact Registry lists. OCI lists each created family within the exact compartment, including DNS record sets and Object Storage objects. GCP zonal Compute `items` may be absent for an empty list: set `emptyListKind: "compute#instanceList"` only for that documented API; an unrecognized object is never interpreted as zero resources. Typed-empty descriptors use `/items` for Compute/Storage, `/rrsets` for Cloud DNS record sets, and `/managedZones` for Cloud DNS zones. Confirm the DNS response-kind literals against the real Mac readback before acceptance. GCP inventory URLs must omit response masks, grouping and partial-success flags; unreachable resources refuse completion. Storage object lists may use `emptyListKind: "storage#objects"`; the runner rejects nonempty grouped prefixes, so use a flat, unfiltered listing of all owned versions. See [Google Storage objects list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/list). Each inventory specifies items/id/tags JSON pointers and provider pagination. Retained bootstrap IDs must be individually reviewed. DNS record sets and registry images without their own tags use `parentOwnership`: independently read the parent's run tag and require the child ID prefix or exact DNS target values to match its current owned endpoint. DNS A/CNAME records need the value binding, not merely a zone name. Raw unbound children refuse cleanup. The real control-plane destroy path still performs its own ownership/proof/approval checks.

Cleanup runs in `finally`, reverse environment order. It requests the existing read-only teardown review, waits for a person and requires consumed approval plus the bound destroy result. Failed consumer cleanup stops destructive producer cleanup. All configured inventories are scanned regardless; pagination, duplicates, unreadable/foreign resources and permission expiry fail closed. Leak scans retry 12 times (5 seconds apart). Credentials revoked, SIGKILL, permission expiry, absent human approval or unavailable services can prevent physical cleanup; there is no false guarantee. The owner must retain the same packet and run `--cleanup` after restoring authority. SIGINT/SIGTERM requests bounded cleanup. No raw provider errors, tokens, bodies or credential paths enter evidence.

Evidence has ledger-compatible `level`, `commit`, `environment`, `result` plus selected requirement/check IDs, parsed packet digest and cleanup counts. Keep the private packet alongside the evidence locally. Artifact path is attached by the verifier when adding a ledger record. Never write `verified`, count NOT RUN as passed, or use selected probes as whole-requirement proof.

## Exact Mac campaign

Node 22; macOS ARM64, 8 GiB RAM, Docker 4 GiB. Run one provider/fixture at a time, one worker, two tiny application replicas at most, bounded 1-hour exercise plus cleanup authority. Use the operated Wave 5 default API/worker/runner installation; its owner supplies the canonical startup command after integration. No Docker/Temporal/kind/browser/cloud startup is performed by this runner. That unresolved startup/packet join is recorded, not substituted with mocks.

Offline checks (no cloud prerequisites):

```bash
node --version # 22.x
npx vitest run --config scripts/acceptance/live/dns/vitest.config.ts scripts/acceptance/live/dns/offline.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=2
npx eslint scripts/acceptance/live
for p in azure gcp oci; do
  npx tsx "scripts/acceptance/live/$p/run.ts" --plan --packet "scripts/acceptance/live/$p/packet.json.example"
done
```

Expected: offline tests pass with zero skips; all plans report zero credential reads/network calls. The denied permission example cannot start a live run.

Provider validation (Mac, no apply, no credentials; downloading pinned provider packages is separate from cloud acceptance):

```bash
for p in azure gcp oci; do
  tofu -chdir="deploy/live-sandbox/$p" init -backend=false
  tofu -chdir="deploy/live-sandbox/$p" validate
done
tofu fmt -check -recursive deploy/live-sandbox
```

Expected: all modules validate with initialized providers. Retain failure diagnostics; HCL validation does not prove live IAM syntax, permission propagation or budget delivery. Owner bootstrap/apply is a separate approved action, never implied by these commands.

Only after accountable live approval and operated fixtures exist, freeze the clean integrated commit. Store packet, token references, permissions and new evidence paths outside the checkout. Set the environment names in the credential section; use one provider at a time:

```bash
export ZENITH_LIVE_AZURE=1 # or ZENITH_LIVE_GCP=1 / ZENITH_LIVE_OCI=1
export ZENITH_LIVE_API_TOKEN_FILE="$HOME/.zenith-live/api-token"
export ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE="$HOME/.zenith-live/approved-root-scope.json"
export ZENITH_LIVE_AZURE_CREDENTIAL_FILE="$HOME/.zenith-live/azure-credential-ref.json"
npx tsx scripts/acceptance/live/azure/run.ts --packet "$HOME/.zenith-live/azure-packet.json" --permissions "$HOME/.zenith-live/permissions.json" --out "$HOME/.zenith-live/azure-evidence.json"
# Same flags and provider-specific credential FILE variable for gcp/run.ts and oci/run.ts.
export ZENITH_LIVE_DNS=1
npx tsx scripts/acceptance/live/dns/run.ts azure --packet "$HOME/.zenith-live/dns-azure-packet.json" --permissions "$HOME/.zenith-live/dns-permissions.json" --out "$HOME/.zenith-live/dns-azure-evidence.json"

```

Expected: selected complete checks report passed_live, all human-approved teardown operations succeed, and every independently queried inventory is empty except individually retained bootstrap IDs. Missing probes, sovereign prerequisite, Wave 5 join, consent or read authority means incomplete/failed, never verified.

The gated Vitest successor is optional orchestration of those same entry points:

```bash
export ZENITH_LIVE_AZURE_PACKET_FILE="$HOME/.zenith-live/azure-packet.json"
export ZENITH_LIVE_PERMISSIONS_FILE="$HOME/.zenith-live/permissions.json"
export ZENITH_LIVE_AZURE_EVIDENCE_FILE="$HOME/.zenith-live/azure-vitest-evidence.json"
npx vitest run --config scripts/acceptance/live/dns/vitest.config.ts scripts/acceptance/live/dns/clouds.live.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=2 -t "live azure"
```

For GCP/OCI replace the three AZURE variables and test filter. DNS uses `ZENITH_LIVE_DNS_PROVIDER`, `ZENITH_LIVE_DNS_PACKET_FILE`, `ZENITH_LIVE_DNS_EVIDENCE_FILE` and filter `live DNS/ACME`. Unselected or ungated tests are explicitly skipped, not passed; inspect counts separately from the standalone receipt.

## Integration and remaining work

The assembler joins the Wave 5 packet emitter, existing permissions envelope and run-tag insertion, registers this custom offline config/gated file in gate manifest, and adds artifact records on the final coherent commit. Existing provider/core/installer/migrations/dependencies/workflows are untouched. No new table or tenancy/inventory classification is needed. Ledger rows touched retain evidence/history and receive implementation_complete_verification_pending with a harness-slice note; no whole-requirement completion is claimed.

### L3 managed, mixed-cloud and release live acceptance

Builder base: `443bfeaf`. This document describes an owner-gated harness, not performed cloud verification. No cloud was called on the Windows builder. `live_sandbox`, `operational_rehearsal` and production signoff remain pending. Acceptance text in `ledger.json` is authoritative; a successful observation is not verification of its entire requirement.

## Entry points and evidence

| Profile | Entry point | Gate | Required scenario catalogue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Managed | `bash scripts/acceptance/managed-acceptance.sh` | `ZENITH_LIVE_MANAGED=1` | MAN-01 through MAN-07 |
| Mixed | `bash scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/acceptance.sh` | `ZENITH_LIVE_MIXED=1` | MIX-01 through MIX-07 |
| Release | `bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh` | `ZENITH_LIVE_RELEASE=1` | All required REL-01 journeys and nine OPS rehearsals |

All three call `scripts/acceptance/live/managed/cli.ts`. Strict recipe validation, plan hashing, the existing `scripts/release/scope.ts`, exact-plan approval, journal and budget reservations are in `plan.ts` and `runner.ts`. `transport.ts` contains actual HTTPS, Kubernetes API and AWS/GCP/Azure inventory calls. `mixed/probes.ts` reuses the existing reference traffic generator, independent price/checksum checker and protected-connectivity checker, and adds TLS peer verification to the direct PostgreSQL readback. Nothing falls back to a mock transport in the CLI.

An owner writes a recipe of specific requests and expected JSON-pointer observations. The engine does not invent these from a model or from expected test results. Each step has a stable id, scenario, scope action, exact target, resource binding when it changes anything, attempt count and interval. Assertions compare JSON values without coercion; a missing field never satisfies `null`. HTTP responses, database rows, cookies, kubeconfig, credentials and provider error text are omitted from public evidence. The recipe itself must contain no secret values: use credential FILE references and product vault references. Sanitization cannot recognize every unknown secret; public evidence uses a fixed output schema instead.

Every scenario id is enumerated by `scenarios(profile)` in `plan.ts`. Missing scenarios remain in `pendingScenarios`. Exit codes: `0` all selected profile observations, cleanup and inventories passed with no pending scenarios; `1` at least one performed check failed; `2` gate/plan/fixture/permission refusal; `3` incomplete profile or cleanup-only completion. Skips, incomplete recipes and cleanup-only runs are never live passes. Evidence is `.data-live/l3/<runId>/report.json`, `journal.json` and, on recovery, `cleanup-report.json`; these are ignored by Git. Results bind the exact source commit, scope digest and recipe digest. No ledger verification flag is set by this tool.

## Owner prerequisites and approvals (DEC-CLOUD)

The owner, not the harness, must provide:

1. Disposable sandbox accounts/projects/subscriptions, exact regions and an existing managed EKS/GKE/AKS/OKE or equivalent cluster. Provisioning, IAM changes, cluster/node-pool creation, production resources, account creation, purchases and accepting terms are outside this harness. Use the normal Zenith installation and browser approval paths for provisioning and source build/release; point observations at their actual operation ids. MAN-01 must use the default composition with no injected test ports.
2. A running sandbox Zenith control plane, real PostgreSQL platform/product stores and Temporal worker/server. For a lean Mac run, use the already operated remote disposable sandbox and cloud cluster. The L3 observer then needs only Node 22 and its existing dependencies, no Docker. Do not boot the full default stack, kind, PostgreSQL and Temporal concurrently on the 8 GB Mac/4 GiB Docker allocation. Local rehearsals below run sequentially against one disposable stack; obtain J1's resource profile after integration rather than guessing unsupported flags.
3. A private GitHub App installation/repository and approved immutable private-source snapshot for source journeys; private registry with real pinned images/provenance; an owned DNS subdomain and DNS write authority through the product, a real ACME issuer/renewal path, gateway and managed object storage/database. These fixtures need owner creation and authorization. Real ACME and registry checks are distinct from local pebble/registry tests.
4. Two disposable tenants, an enforcing CNI (Cilium for FQDN egress), a sandbox RuntimeClass/node pool (J14), limits and an explicitly reviewed noisy-neighbour load bound. Do not disable assertions or substitute namespaces for isolation. Record provisional load/SLO bounds and exact environment.
5. Stripe **test mode** account/customer/webhook setup for MAN-06. Do not change real billing or charge a customer. MAN-07 pricing/terms remain provisional (DEC-BUSINESS); suspension must preserve data and permit export. Destructive retention needs DEC-RETENTION, is outside these recipes, and stays disabled. Production release signing/signoff need their separate owner decisions; this harness grants neither.
6. For mixed traffic: GCP web compute, Azure PostgreSQL, AWS enricher/function, real protected network/TLS/identity/secret bindings and separate approved partition connections/backends. An equivalent placement needs a written owner-reviewed justification; row markers alone do not establish provider identity. Independently observe actual provider resources/receipts as well as the direct database readback.
7. Protected-endpoint probes from **both** an allowlisted and an outside-allowlist machine, with the valid client certificate, key and CA files. One vantage point cannot prove both access and denial. Include both observations in the campaign dossier; one successful recipe is not complete MIX-05 evidence.
8. Genuine owner/browser session cookie FILE for browser-only routes (including prior MFA step-up when required), scoped bearer token FILE for reads, static short-lived kubeconfig FILE, temporary AWS credential JSON FILE, GCP/Azure access token FILEs and read-only PostgreSQL URI/CA FILEs as applicable. Files must be absolute, private regular files (0600 on macOS); no ambient credential chains, exec/auth-provider kubeconfig plugins, metadata credential fallback or TLS bypass. Kubeconfig embeds CA and optional client certificate/key data; its exact context and server must match the plan.
9. Review and approve budget/grants using the existing interactive permissions CLI. `permissions.json` ships unapproved, and **does not currently grant managed/release mutations**. `--plan` emits a proposed grant to review; the integrator/owner adds the grant to an owner-local manifest and approves its digest. The builder does not edit or approve that file. Managed uses `managed-acceptance-live`, mixed uses `mixed-traffic-live`, release uses `release-acceptance-live`. Mixed fault injection also requires `inject_fault` and any cluster provider grant; the shipped mixed grant does not include them.
10. A separate exact-plan approval FILE, described below, and a shared absolute budget FILE for L1/L2/L3 reservations. Explicit price projection must include the run window of pre-existing resources, egress, storage, idle time and cleanup. Every cloud provider needs a positive projection; reserve is allocated proportionally when checking provider caps. Bundled placeholder prices are never executable.

## Exact Mac commands

Start from the clean, committed integrated verifier RC, Node 22 and existing node_modules. Do not install dependencies as part of this harness. Owner creates a private working directory outside the checkout:

```bash
node --version                             # must be v22.x
umask 077
export L3_PRIVATE="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/zenith-l3-owner.XXXXXX")"
bash scripts/acceptance/managed-acceptance.sh --template > "$L3_PRIVATE/managed.recipe.json"
bash scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/acceptance.sh --template > "$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.recipe.json"
bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --template > "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
# Owner edits recipes: actual targets/ids, tagged resources, assertion matrix below,
# timestamps, full price projection, approved cleanup, all independent inventories.
bash scripts/acceptance/managed-acceptance.sh --plan --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/managed.recipe.json" > "$L3_PRIVATE/managed.plan.json"
bash scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/acceptance.sh --plan --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.recipe.json" > "$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.plan.json"
bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --plan --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json" > "$L3_PRIVATE/release.plan.json"
```

These commands read neither credential FILEs nor a cloud. Templates are deliberately incomplete and use `.invalid` targets; execution refuses them. Template generation itself is not readiness evidence. Fill all scenarios, rather than repeating the same operation-status assertion under different scenario ids.

The owner creates `$L3_PRIVATE/permissions.json` from the reviewed manifest, adds only needed proposed grants within the existing per-run/per-provider/total/TTL budgets, and approves it interactively:

```bash
export ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/permissions.json"
npx tsx scripts/release/permissions-cli.ts show
npx tsx scripts/release/permissions-cli.ts approve --by 'Arnav Bule'
npx tsx scripts/release/permissions-cli.ts check
```

Then rerun each `--plan` command with that scope. The owner writes a private exact-plan approval JSON per recipe (no secret, no automatic approval). Fields must be actual values from that plan and manifest, not the placeholders below:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "decision": "DEC-CLOUD",
  "approvedBy": "Arnav Bule",
  "approvedAt": "<actual approval ISO timestamp>",
  "expiresAt": "<actual ISO timestamp covering the run plus cleanup>",
  "planSha256": "<plan.sha256>",
  "scopeDigest": "<permissions-cli digest>",
  "sourceCommit": "<integrated verifier RC SHA>"
}
```

Store cookies/tokens/kubeconfig via the owner's authenticated tooling, never in recipes or shell literals. Export only FILE references (recipe `credentialRef`, `caRef`, `certRef`, `keyRef` name these env variables). Example profile invocation, after all prerequisites and exact approval:

```bash
export ZENITH_L3_BROWSER_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/browser.cookie"
export ZENITH_L3_KUBECONFIG_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/kubeconfig"
export ZENITH_L3_BUDGET_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/budget.json"
export ZENITH_L3_OUT="$PWD/.data-live/l3"
export ZENITH_L3_APPROVAL_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/managed.approval.json"
ZENITH_LIVE_MANAGED=1 bash scripts/acceptance/managed-acceptance.sh --run --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/managed.recipe.json"

export ZENITH_L3_APPROVAL_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.approval.json"
ZENITH_LIVE_MIXED=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/acceptance.sh --run --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.recipe.json"

export ZENITH_L3_APPROVAL_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/release.approval.json"
ZENITH_LIVE_RELEASE=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --run --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
```

Run **once per recipe/run id**. No forward effects are automatically resumed. Gated vitest alternative (choose one profile; do not first run the same recipe via its shell):

```bash
export ZENITH_L3_MANAGED_RECIPE_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/managed.recipe.json"
ZENITH_LIVE_MANAGED=1 npx vitest run tests/acceptance/live-l3.gated.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
# For mixed/release, use ZENITH_L3_MIXED_RECIPE_FILE or ZENITH_L3_RELEASE_RECIPE_FILE,
# the matching profile gate and exact-plan approval FILE. Other profiles are SKIPPED.
```

Expected: active profile has 1 actual passing live test only when its CLI exits 0; two other profiles explicitly skip. Without gates all 3 skip and establish no live evidence. Recipe counts depend on the reviewed observation matrix, and the JSON report provides exact performed/failed/not-run counts. A runtime failure always attempts every reviewed cleanup entry and every independent inventory. Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM by letting the current bounded call settle and cleanup finish. SIGKILL/power loss cannot execute `finally`.

## Required observation matrix

Owner recipes must map **each acceptance clause** to concrete normal-product receipts and independent resource/traffic observations. `http` and `kubernetes` steps support exact JSON-pointer expectations and bounded polling. Use `{ "pointer": "/p95Ms", "min": 0, "max": 500 }` for a finite measured bound, or `equals` for exact JSON equality; never both. Missing, nonnumeric or nonfinite measurements fail. They do not manufacture operational rehearsal evidence. The release profile requires all 16 existing REL-01 scenario ids plus these nine OPS rehearsal ids. Use new ids for each distinct check.

| Rows | Required real observations |
| --- | --- |
| MAN-01 | Default session/tenant identity and refused cross-tenant access; immutable private source/build isolation/provenance and registry digest; real release ready pods and serving health. Never use the legacy kind fixture's synthetic next digest as a real successful release. |
| MAN-02/03 | Registry pull/readback, Gateway/route, issued certificate SAN/issuer/expiry and real TLS; vault secret delivery without exposing it; tenant object storage positive/negative access; managed DB identity; DNS proof, renewal/revocation; export/restore content checksums; HPA metrics/load and catalog capability readback. |
| MAN-04/05 | Two tenants with positive controls plus route/storage/CNI/metadata/FQDN egress/pod-security/quota/operator denial; sandbox RuntimeClass actually running; CPU/memory/disk/PID exhaustion and measured victim p95 within recorded provisional bounds. A configuration object alone is insufficient. |
| MAN-06/07 | Real Stripe test invoice/event reconciliation and idempotent replay; plan assignment, meter/quotas; BYOC without billing; suspension refuses new work while preserving row/resource counts and allowing export; reinstatement. Pricing/terms and destructive retention stay undecided. |
| MIX-01/02 | `mixed_evidence` request to the real stored plan verifies separate accounts/connections/backends, immutable child/semantics digests, durable receipts, dependency order and stable addresses. Independently read actual child resources; stored receipts alone do not prove provider reality. |
| MIX-03/04 | Typed output provenance/scope, sealed references, changed materialization demands review; cycles and missing authority refused; partial success/timeout/expiry/cancel/outage/drift/migration block safely; no destructive compensation. Capture real operation/refusal receipts and reverse-order destroy release/sync. |
| MIX-05 | `connectivity` request pins endpoint hostname, DNS targets, TLS minimum, SPKI, valid mTLS material, approved allowlist. Include both vantage points. Verify actual route/firewall/private endpoint and overlap handling separately. Database public exposure cannot be silently accepted. |
| MIX-06 | `mixed_traffic` baseline and recovered requests: GCP entry, Azure direct PostgreSQL TLS read-only transaction, AWS enricher markers and actual cloud resource reads. Checker recomputes price/checksum, rejects missing/duplicate/phantom/rejected rows and checks idempotent replay. No app readback endpoint is accepted. |
| MIX-07 | `scale_deployment` for an exact tagged disposable GCP Kubernetes-equivalent Deployment (zero replicas requires `inject_fault`); observe outage and direct DB uncertain writes, then restore replicas and observe readiness/traffic. Owner documents equivalence. Other compute fault modes require owner-operated real fault and heal plus independent observations. Read actual economics response with priced transfer/residency/latency terms; prices are estimates, not invoices. |
| OPS-01 | `slo-measurement`: measured availability/latency/capacity and restore-derived RPO/RTO; objective approval remains provisional unless separately signed off. |
| OPS-02 | `control-plane-outage-fairness`: actual outage and read-only maintenance receipts, tenant queue/backpressure/fairness measurements, serving independent workload, correlated dashboards/alerts successfully imported. |
| OPS-03 | `rolling-upgrade-replay`: actual in-flight histories across N-1/N API/worker/runner, replay result, compatibility refusal and rollback readback. |
| OPS-04 | `clean-host-restore`: fresh host/store identities, restored stores/artifacts/Temporal/customer state, consumed approvals refuse reuse and old epoch refuses writes until explicit reconciliation/reopen. |
| OPS-05 | `key-rotation-decrypt-history`: purpose ids, active/decrypt-only states, old ciphertext/history remains readable, wrong-purpose refusal and real KMS/HSM audit receipts where claimed. Never expose material. |
| OPS-06/07 | `persistence-leak-scan` of operated stores/logs/history with runtime canaries; `archive-hold-dry-run` sealed object verify/restore/hold and preview counts. No deletion or general perfect-redaction claim. |
| OPS-08 | `independent-adversarial`: independent reviewer/tester performs tenant/role/stale approval/SSRF/rebinding/prompt/archive/build/exfiltration/forgery/escalation/integration-compromise probes against the operated stack/cloud metadata surfaces. This builder's offline tests are not independent acceptance. |
| OPS-09 | `signed-release-audit`: independently verified real artifacts/SBOM/provenance/updater signature/triage/audit chain. Local ephemeral signing key is rehearsal only; actual tag release needs the separate signing-key decision. |
| REL-01 | All existing required scenario ids: install, private-source, plan-approval, dns-tls, stateful-traffic, update-rollback, machine-schedules, drift-repair, revocation, crash-partition, rotation, upgrade, restore, two-tenants, export, teardown. Include their actual operational receipts and independent cloud traffic/readback. |
| REL-02/03/04 | Generate dossier at exact RC, retain pending/skipped entries and full environment; no automatic production signoff; exact digest/target/budget approval and conservative attempted-effect journal with next cleanup command. |

## Tagging, cleanup and inventory limitations

Tag owned resources during their normal disposable provisioning. Do not stamp a tag on an unrelated object to make cleanup pass. Canonical cloud tags/annotations are `zenith:live-run=<runId>` and `zenith:ttl-expires=<startedAt + ttlMinutes ISO>`. Kubernetes also needs label `zenith.dev/live-run=<runId>`; GCP uses label `zenith_live_run=<runId>` because colon keys are not supported. Independent ownership reads must match exact run and TTL plus the pinned pointer assertions before any mutation/delete. Namespace deletion uses live UID and resourceVersion preconditions, never `--all` or a wildcard name. Deployment scale uses live identity/resourceVersion and exact replicas; approved cleanup can restore its declared baseline before namespace teardown. This is preauthorized fixture cleanup, never automatic mixed compensation.

Mixed teardown POSTs can **only release/sync already human-approved child destroy operations** at the existing browser-only route. Include their terminal status polling and sync steps in dependency order before inventories. The harness cannot propose a new approval or release an unapproved destroy operation. Missing, stale, expired or revoked approvals yield failure, including during cleanup; no expiry bypass exists. Approve a cleanup window longer than the run TTL.

Independent scans check Kubernetes namespaces/PVs/ClusterRoles/ClusterRoleBindings bearing the run label; AWS Resource Groups Tagging API (with independently checked STS account and explicit commercial-region endpoints); GCP Cloud Asset Search within exact project; Azure resource inventory within exact subscription. Cloud scans paginate with bounded calls and reject unreadable or incomplete responses. K8s inventories reject continuation tokens rather than declaring an incomplete page empty. AWS/GCP/ARM tag indexes can lag or omit unsupported/global/untaggable resources; zero here covers the **declared indexed inventory only**. Add provider-specific direct reads for every provisioned kind, including volumes, DNS, registry images and global IAM, via L1/L2 and the owner campaign. An empty generic tag index alone is insufficient for the ledger's full zero-leak acceptance. OCI inventory is refused, not approximated.

On interruption, use the **same** committed checkout, recipe, source digest, scope, credential refs and original out directory. Investigate a crash `run.lock` before removing that specific lock; the tool never silently steals a lock. Retry cleanup, not forward effects:

```bash
ZENITH_LIVE_MANAGED=1 bash scripts/acceptance/managed-acceptance.sh --cleanup-only --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/managed.recipe.json"
ZENITH_LIVE_MIXED=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/acceptance.sh --cleanup-only --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.recipe.json"
ZENITH_LIVE_RELEASE=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --cleanup-only --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
```

Cleanup-only success exits 3 (scenarios remain not run). A failed teardown or nonempty/unreadable inventory exits 1 and requires owner remediation. All entries are attempted even after an earlier cleanup fails. Budget reservations remain conservatively charged after cleanup and are never auto-refunded. Retain evidence and budget book until the owner reconciles actual spend and scans every supported resource kind.

## Local Mac verification and integration joins

Offline Windows/Mac contract commands:

Mac local-engine/cluster rehearsal commands (sequential, one worker; not run here):

# operated sandbox for L3 rather than weakening the install acceptance.

npx tsx scripts/release/dossier.ts --out .data-live/release-dossier.md --json .data-live/release-dossier.json
```

Original per-requirement verify documents retain precise engine/ops environment requirements. Legacy `managed-kind.test.ts` establishes object/build contracts, **not** running a real next release digest, platform DB/Temporal, cloud DNS/ACME, or paying tenants. The local isolation suite currently refuses non-kind contexts and is not quietly reused on a cloud cluster. Full default-journey/isolation/ops receipt producers must come from J1/J2/J4/J5/J6/J11/J14/J15 and the verifier campaign; L3 consumes genuine observations rather than injecting replacements.

The merged tree provides AWS-specific L1 plan/Guard/Transport/ProductScenarioPort contracts alongside the L2 and L3 runners. This job defines its helper under `live/managed` and shares the existing release Scope/digest and MIX checker interfaces. Final integration shares the conservative budget-book schema/lock, exact tag checks, absence checks and teardown helpers in `scripts/acceptance/live/shared.ts` across L1/L2/L3. Separate exact-plan approval FILEs retain the strict root Scope schema. Owner-reviewed managed/release grants and actual product observations remain prerequisites; no fixture observation promotes a product requirement. J12 remains owner of dossier/signoff status logic. No schema/migration need, package/lock changes or published SQL edits in L3.
