# DRV-1: operated private-source and update-rollback drivers

Built on `7d52b372` in `prod7-drivers-d1`, 2026-10-08. Verification status is
`implementation_complete_verification_pending`. These two dedicated drivers serve
the corresponding J15 scenarios in **PROD-REL-01**. Their receipts are
`local_operated_rehearsal`, never live or production acceptance. The Windows builder
has not run Docker, PostgreSQL, Temporal, kind or Chromium.

## Operations and boundaries

Both drivers reuse the actual J1 lean installation and J2 identity, MFA, browser,
agent-link, native kind connection and observer helpers. They create fresh local
users, workspace, project and production environment. Deploy/rollback proposals go
through the real action API. Both approval rounds use the operation review browser
page and a distinct MFA-enrolled administrator; self approval must return 403.
The real Temporal worker executes the approved operation. Independent PostgreSQL
queries use J1's verified-TLS pooler, and a separate kubectl process reads the J2
observer target. The browser-linked scoped agent also reads each actual operation's
events through the production MCP endpoint, requiring a nonsimulated envelope and
nonempty events. No SQL creates an approval or changes an operation's status.
Before any observer request, the driver checks J2's private target journal,
exact container ID, published loopback socket and matching cluster CA. Only inline
static client certificates/keys in the one expected context are admitted; remote
servers, different ports/CAs, TLS bypass, proxies and exec-auth plugins refuse.

| Scenario | Real operations and independent checks | Deliberate boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| private-source | Browser GitHub installation/OAuth callback, single-use PKCE exchange, connected binding, private branch source proposal, retained snapshot/plan review, branch movement, browser approval and browser revocation while the owned worker is paused, resumed worker refusal, unchanged PostgreSQL snapshot, authenticated pinned archive counters, zero provider effects/workloads | GitHub is an authenticated local wire emulator, including real runtime RSA signatures and contents:read token scope. Revocation intentionally prevents build/apply. Successful private builds, dedicated build nodes and live GitHub are not established. |
| update-rollback | Baseline deploy, distinct compatible image deploy, independent digest/pod/application marker and stable workload UID, genuine empty-nonce process crash and failed rollout, old ready application still serving, browser-approved exact original revision rollback, independent release rows/API agreement and preserved product record | The compatible image changes its OCI configuration while retaining J2's inert witness binary. This proves the code-release path, not a database migration or restore. |

The private-source scenario is the catalog's **admission by approved snapshot**
scenario. Its reviewed build declaration is parsed with production J6 validation;
it is not a receipt for running isolation. It has distinct writer/verifier vault
references and tenant-derived names, but intentionally provisions no build secret,
node or runtime. A successful private-build campaign remains with J6 and the live
acceptance program. The closed eight-check inventory makes these limits explicit.

The pause injection inspects the exact J1 worker installation label, records an
unpause recovery before injecting, then approves/revokes through the browser. This
prevents a race with execution. Update failure waits for the real Kubernetes
progress deadline, then independently observes CrashLoopBackOff/restarts and the
previous ready application. It does not set a deployment/operation result itself.

Cleanup always attempts recoveries, operation settlement/lease absence, exact
environment-owned Kubernetes UID deletes, credential revocation, auth-user absence,
browser shutdown and fixture removal, even after another cleanup task fails. It
refuses workload deletion beneath an unsettled writer. Source setup registers
cleanup before OpenSSL/engine mutations, restores the original hash-checked J1
composition, and checks absence of its private container/volume and overlay mounts.
Update cleanup removes only its generated host/kind image references. Both fixtures
also carry the owning J1 installation label for outer cleanup after interruption.
Registry/cache content blobs and platform audit records remain in borrowed targets
until their owner's J1/J2 teardown; the outer cleanup below is mandatory. No global
prune or shared-namespace deletion occurs in either driver.

## Exact lean-profile Mac commands

Run sequentially on native ARM64 macOS, Node 22, Docker Desktop 4 GiB RAM/4 GiB swap,
Supabase CLI 2.75.0, OpenSSL, kind, kubectl and the existing installed Playwright
Chromium. Use a disposable verifier user/VM where Chromium genuinely trusts the
fresh J1 CA. Prepare that trust using the existing J2 verifier procedure after J1
startup; neither driver bypasses TLS or changes a personal trust store. Node must
start with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` pointing at this same actual CA. A certificate
error fails the lane.

Preserve at least J1's 22 GiB disk floor. Lean J1 has a planned 2912 MiB running
ceiling, J2 adds a single 640 MiB kind node, and private-source adds one 64 MiB
provider fixture (also one temporary 64 MiB seed container). This is not measured
capacity proof. Stop LocalStack, Pebble, stripe-mock and unrelated heavy profiles
before starting; these two scenarios need only the J1 registry and J2 kind target.
Run image compilation and tests serially. See [PKG-04](PKG-04.md) for pinned/native
J1 setup and [J6](J6-ISOLATED-BUILDER.md) for the separate build-isolation campaign.

Owner-provided inputs, already resolved and inspected locally:

- `ZENITH_NODE22_BIN`: absolute directory containing native Node 22.
- `ZENITH_DEFAULT_STACK_REGISTRY_IMAGE`: real digest-pinned ARM64 registry image.
- `DRV1_KIND_IMAGE`: real digest-pinned ARM64 kind node image.
- `DRV1_WITNESS_IMAGE`: actual local `localhost:5000/zenith-j2-witness@sha256:...`
  image with its original local tag, built by J2's `zenithd.Dockerfile` using its
  reviewed digest-pinned builder/runtime inputs. Both Docker image and local
  registry digest must exist before J2 prepare. Do not substitute a dummy pin.
- `DRV1_WITNESS_TAG`: the original `localhost:5000/zenith-j2-witness:<tag>` for that
  inspected image. J1 creates a fresh empty registry, so republish this exact local
  image into it after startup and independently check its original digest below.
- `ZENITH_LOCAL_SOURCE_BUILD_DECLARATION_FILE`: absolute regular 0600 JSON file
  outside the checkout, with `{ "config": <reviewed J6 ConfigSchema>,
  "registryRepositoryRoot": "localhost:5000/zenith-drv1-build" }`. The schema
  requires real pinned builder/proxy image references, runtimeClass, seccomp and
  AppArmor names, node isolation profile digest/systemDaemonSets, and a distinct
  proxy namespace/IP/port/destinations. Review this declaration as intended
  semantics only. The driver derives the actual fresh tenant namespaces and key;
  it deliberately never tries the declared build credentials or executes source.

Use canonical `/private/tmp` paths: `/var` and `/tmp` aliases fail private-path
symlink guards. The setup chooses directories that do not exist. Keep all private
config, host env and raw test reports out of source and uploaded artifacts.

```

Each gate requires **1 passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**, plus its fresh receipt with
all eight checks passed. Update can take more than ten minutes because the failed
rollout uses the unchanged Kubernetes progress deadline. Fresh roots are mandatory
for every rerun. If J2 preparation stopped before recording a container identity,
the outer cleanup refuses name-only deletion; its owner must establish ownership
from the private preparation journal. J1 cleanup can run even when J2 cleanup
fails. Missing prerequisites, skipped cases, pending cleanup or a missing receipt
are not acceptance. No credential, source archive, private journal, trace or raw
HTTP response belongs in a public packet. Publish only the sanitized fixed-schema
receipts after inspecting their check statuses and explicit limits.

Alternative **scenario-runner** entry points, on the same prepared targets and a
new root per command (choose these instead of reusing the gate test roots):

```bash
export ZENITH_LOCAL_RUN_ID=drv1-srccli
export ZENITH_LOCAL_ROOT="$(mktemp -d "$DRV1_PRIVATE/zenith-j15-$ZENITH_LOCAL_RUN_ID-XXXXXX")"
node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs scripts/release/local-target-runner.ts run \
  --scenario private-source --receipt "$ZENITH_LOCAL_ROOT/private-source.json"
export ZENITH_LOCAL_RUN_ID=drv1-updcli
export ZENITH_LOCAL_ROOT="$(mktemp -d "$DRV1_PRIVATE/zenith-j15-$ZENITH_LOCAL_RUN_ID-XXXXXX")"
node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs scripts/release/local-target-runner.ts run \
  --scenario update-rollback --receipt "$ZENITH_LOCAL_ROOT/update-rollback.json"
```

Exit 0 means the driver checks and cleanup passed. Exit 1 is failure, 2 gated
refusal, 3 incomplete checks. The J15 acceptance orchestrator's `--local-targets`
selection reaches these same registered drivers and preserves their operated label.
The existing component-only lanes and all other target registrations remain intact.

## Files and integration joins

New drivers: `operated.ts`, `github-emulator.mjs`, `github-fixture.ts`,
`private-source.ts`, `update-rollback.ts` under `scripts/release/drivers/`.
Offline tests: `tests/release/drivers/drv1.test.ts`. Gated successors:
`tests/acceptance/drv1-{private-source,update-rollback}.operated.test.ts`.

Minimal additive joins: `scripts/release/scenarios.ts` (component test mapping and
truthful limits), `local-targets.ts` (only two owned overrides, strict operated
receipt inventories/label and J1 CA propagation), `local-target-runner.ts`
(dispatch), `acceptance-orchestrator.ts` (operated label and canonical Mac temp
parent), `scripts/ci/gate-manifest.mjs` (two gated lanes, exact required cases and
offline contract inventory), and `tests/ci/assert-lane-report.mjs` (strict CLI
lane registration). No migration, SQL snapshot, package, lockfile, workflow, commit
or live-cloud change.

Exactly one existing test expectation changed: `tests/release/local-targets.test.ts`
previously required all catalog entries to have only generic J15 gates and the
`local_rehearsal` label. These two dedicated operated scenarios now additionally
require DRV-1/J1/J2 gates and `local_operated_rehearsal`; the assertion checks those
stronger exact expectations while retaining every other scenario's old checks.
No assertion or gate was removed or weakened.

## Windows validation record

Every shell prepended `C:\Users\user\.local\sdk\node22` to PATH. Read-only program,
git status/log, source inspection and patch commands did not execute an engine.
Pass/fail/skip counts below refer to checks, tests or diagnostics as indicated;
successive test counts overlap and must not be summed.

1. Initial changed-file lint, **1 check passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**, no warnings:

   ```text
   npx eslint scripts/release/drivers/operated.ts scripts/release/drivers/github-emulator.mjs scripts/release/drivers/github-fixture.ts scripts/release/drivers/private-source.ts scripts/release/drivers/update-rollback.ts scripts/release/local-targets.ts scripts/release/local-target-runner.ts scripts/release/scenarios.ts scripts/release/acceptance-orchestrator.ts scripts/ci/gate-manifest.mjs tests/release/drivers/drv1.test.ts tests/release/local-targets.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-private-source.operated.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-update-rollback.operated.test.ts
   ```

2. Initial scoped run, **50 tests passed / 0 assertion failures / 0 skipped**, but
   **3 collection failures / 3 passed files**, exit 1. The new helper imported
   unavailable `pg`; corrected to the repository's installed `postgres` client.
   No dependency installation or test relaxation:

   ```text
   npx vitest run tests/release/drivers/drv1.test.ts tests/release/local-targets.test.ts tests/release/orchestrator.test.ts tests/release/acceptance-scenarios.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-private-source.operated.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-update-rollback.operated.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=2
   ```

3. Corrected targeted run, **15 passed / 0 failed / 2 skipped**, 1 passed file and
   2 skipped operated files, exit 0:

   ```text
   npx vitest run tests/release/drivers/drv1.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-private-source.operated.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-update-rollback.operated.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=2
   ```

4. First serialized typecheck, **0 checks passed / 1 failed / 0 skipped**, exit 1,
   3 TypeScript diagnostics (host env inference and two untyped JS-helper callback
   parameters). Fixed the actual type annotations:

   ```text
   bash Z:/Projects/Spawned.ai/zenith-wt/.resume/codex/tsc-serial.sh
   ```

5. Expanded final scoped run (same exact command as item 2), **66 passed / 0 failed
   / 2 skipped**, 4 passed files and 2 skipped operated files, exit 0. Includes
   real RSA/PKCE transport controls, immutable archive agreement with production,
   source/release readback rejection, receipt closure and failed-cleanup ordering.

6. Expanded 15-file lint, **1 check passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**, exit 0, no
   errors/warnings. This exact command also passed three more times: after the two
   additional type fixes, after adding the required MCP event-readback join and
   after adding exact local observer admission.

   ```text
   npx eslint scripts/release/drivers/operated.ts scripts/release/drivers/github-emulator.mjs scripts/release/drivers/github-fixture.ts scripts/release/drivers/private-source.ts scripts/release/drivers/update-rollback.ts scripts/release/local-targets.ts scripts/release/local-target-runner.ts scripts/release/scenarios.ts scripts/release/acceptance-orchestrator.ts scripts/ci/gate-manifest.mjs tests/ci/assert-lane-report.mjs tests/release/drivers/drv1.test.ts tests/release/local-targets.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-private-source.operated.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-update-rollback.operated.test.ts
   ```

7. Second serialized typecheck (same command as item 4), **0 checks passed / 1
   failed / 0 skipped**, exit 1, 2 diagnostics introduced by the cleanup/PKCE
   additions: inferred JS command output and dynamic redirect headers. Fixed
   explicit return/header types; no runtime or assertion behavior changed.

8. Third serialized typecheck (same exact command as item 4), **1 check passed /
   0 failed / 0 skipped**, exit 0, zero diagnostics. Fourth serialized typecheck
   after the required MCP operation-events join also **1 passed / 0 failed / 0
   skipped**, exit 0. No direct `npx tsc` command was used.

9. Real skipped-report control, **16 passed / 0 failed / 2 skipped**, 1 passed
   file and 2 skipped files, exit 0:

   ```text
   npx vitest run tests/release/drivers/drv1.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-private-source.operated.test.ts tests/acceptance/drv1-update-rollback.operated.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=2 --reporter=default --reporter=json --outputFile.json=C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Temp/zenith-drv1-builder-gates.json
   ```

   The following strict validators each exited **1**, with **0 accepted required
   cases / 1 rejected skipped required case / 0 validator omissions**. Both are
   expected rejection controls, not operated test passes or unexplained failures:

   ```text
   node tests/ci/assert-lane-report.mjs drv1-private-source C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Temp/zenith-drv1-builder-gates.json
   node tests/ci/assert-lane-report.mjs drv1-update-rollback C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Temp/zenith-drv1-builder-gates.json
   ```

10. Post-MCP-join scoped tests (same exact command as item 3), **16 passed / 0
    failed / 2 skipped**, 1 passed file and 2 skipped files, exit 0.

11. Registry CLIs, each **1 check passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**, exit 0. Manifest
    output names each exact operated case and required gates. Scenario inventory
    reports **19 scenarios / 80 mapped files, all present** (run twice, both pass):

    ```text
    node scripts/ci/gate-manifest.mjs drv1-private-source
    node scripts/ci/gate-manifest.mjs drv1-update-rollback
    node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs scripts/release/acceptance-orchestrator.ts check
    ```

12. `git diff --check`: each invocation **1 check passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**,
    exit 0. Read-only `git status --short`, `git log --oneline -10`, `git diff
    --stat` and source diffs/reads/searches have no test pass/fail/skip counts.
    Missing guessed inspection paths produced read errors and were corrected by
    locating the real paths; they were not test executions. No git mutation ran.

13. Final local-observer contracts (same exact six-file command as item 2), **67
    passed / 0 failed / 2 skipped**, 4 passed files and 2 skipped operated files,
    exit 0. The added test refuses wrong container identity, remote/wrong-port
    targets, wrong CA, TLS bypass, proxy redirection and executable credentials.

14. Fifth serialized typecheck (item 4 command), **0 checks passed / 1 failed / 0
    skipped**, exit 1, one diagnostic: the existing JS assertion cannot narrow an
    optional config filename for the new typed path call. Added its explicit
    nonnull type annotation after the unchanged runtime guard. No assertion or
    runtime behavior changed.

15. Final sixth serialized typecheck (same exact item 4 command), **1 check passed
    / 0 failed / 0 skipped**, exit 0, zero diagnostics. Earlier failed attempts
    remain recorded above; the final source passes.

16. Final annotation-only file lint, **1 check passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**,
    exit 0, no errors/warnings. The other 14 files passed the full changed-file
    command before this final type-only edit:

    ```text
    npx eslint scripts/release/drivers/operated.ts
    ```

17. Extracted all fenced Mac bash commands into the following builder temp file
    using PowerShell (UTF-8 without BOM), then parsed without executing them,
    **1 syntax check passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**, exit 0:

    ```text
    bash -n C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Temp/zenith-drv1-mac-commands.sh
    ```

    This proves shell syntax only. It does not change any operated verdict.
    The same syntax command passed a second time after adding exact local witness
    republication and independent registry-digest readback to the Mac setup.

The two actual operated cases are **not run
(needs native Mac Docker/PostgreSQL/Temporal/kind/Chromium)**. Live cloud acceptance
is deferred by the owner and was not attempted. J4 schedules, ACME, billing,
LocalStack and full J6 private builds are outside these scenario slices.

Handoff deviation: no successful private-build deployment is claimed or performed;
the dedicated driver implements the catalog's private-source snapshot-admission
and revocation boundary. All additional shared-file edits above are necessary
additive runner, TLS, receipt and gate joins, as authorized by the handoff.

Suggested commit: `feat(release): add operated source and rollback drivers`.
