# Isolated-build security profiles: owner review

**APPROVED by the owner on 2026-10-21; runc fallback for disposable verification approved 2026-10-23 (last section).** The profiles are wired only into the `drv1-private-source` lane of `operated-gate-linux.yml`. `ZENITH_ISOLATED_BUILD_PROFILES` is not set in any product deployment.

Untrusted-source builds run in a rootless BuildKit pod. The pod needs three node-side things before it will start: a seccomp profile (which system calls are allowed), an AppArmor profile (which files, networks and capabilities are allowed) and a RuntimeClass (which sandbox runs the pod). The drafts are in `deploy/zenith-managed/build/profiles/`.

## What each profile does

**Seccomp (default deny).** Everything not listed fails with EPERM. The allow list starts from Docker's default profile (moby/profiles `seccomp/default.json`, main branch fetched 2026-10-21, latest tag `seccomp/v0.2.4`, file SHA-256 `6416b477...053f6`) and removes what a 64-bit builder never needs: 32-bit and x32 variants, clock adjustment, fanotify, `memfd_secret`. Allowed groups: files, memory, processes and signals, time and polling, sockets and IPC. Each group carries a comment in the file. Three groups need a reason:
- `socket()` only for unix, IPv4/IPv6 TCP and UDP, and route-netlink. Raw, packet, vsock, key and crypto sockets are refused.
- Group A (`unshare`, `clone`, `setns`, `pivot_root`, `chroot`, `sethostname`) and group B (`mount`, `umount2`, the new mount API) are allowed because rootless BuildKit builds a nested user and mount namespace for every `RUN` step. Docker's default profile only allows these with CAP_SYS_ADMIN, which this pod deliberately lacks, so I made them unconditional.
- `clone3` and the keyring calls return ENOSYS so libc and runc fall back cleanly.
Explicitly denied (and listed so the intent is visible): kexec, module loading, reboot, `bpf`, `perf_event_open`, `userfaultfd`, `io_uring`, `ptrace` and cross-process memory access, `keyctl`/`add_key`/`request_key`, `open_by_handle_at`, clock setting, swap, quota, NUMA policy, raw I/O ports.

**AppArmor `zenith-build`.** Allows TCP/UDP and unix sockets; denies raw and packet sockets. Allows only the capabilities rootless BuildKit uses (setuid/setgid for the UID helpers, sys_admin for mounts inside the nested namespace) and denies net_raw, net_admin, sys_module, sys_rawio, sys_ptrace, sys_time and similar. Denies every write under `/proc/sys` and `/sys`, `/proc/sysrq-trigger`, kernel memory and block devices, and mounting of kernel-internal filesystems (debugfs, securityfs, bpf, tracefs). This matters because the Job sets `procMount: Unmasked`, which switches off the runtime's normal read-only masking of `/proc`.
**Deviation from your brief:** I did not add "deny writes outside the workspace and /tmp". The profile also confines every build step, and a step writes into its own root filesystem, which AppArmor sees as `/`. Such a rule would break every `RUN`. Write confinement for the outer container already comes from the Job spec: read-only root filesystem, and writable volumes only at `/work`, `/tmp`, `/run/user/1000`, `/home/user`.

**RuntimeClass `zenith-build-gvisor`.** Handler `runsc` (gVisor), the one J14 already installs; same overhead (50m CPU, 64Mi) and node selector (`zenith.dev/runtime=gvisor`) as J14's `zenith-gvisor`. I made a separate class instead of reusing the J14 object so changing one lane's class cannot change the other's recorded baseline. Why gVisor: it puts a user-space kernel between untrusted build code and the host kernel, which matters most here because the seccomp and AppArmor profiles must allow user namespaces and mounts. Caveat: J14 only tested ordinary tenant pods under gVisor. Nobody has shown that rootless BuildKit, `hostUsers: false` and the builder's own user-namespace probe work under `runsc`. If that fails, the fallback is a runc/crun class with the same two profiles.

## Residual risks (not protected against)
- Mount and user-namespace syscalls are open to tenant code. Seccomp cannot limit them by target; the kernel (or gVisor) is the real gate, so a kernel or gVisor escape bug is not covered.
- Anything the build can reach through the allowed proxy (the allowlist proxy cannot inspect TLS contents).
- `ptrace` denial breaks `strace`, `gdb` and `proot` inside builds. 32-bit binaries are killed.
- CPU, memory and disk exhaustion is limited by the Job's limits, not by these profiles.
- Whether runsc applies AppArmor to guest processes, and honors the userns mapping, is unconfirmed (see open questions).

## How it will be wired (after approval)
`review-profile.ts` hashes the three files and fills in the digest. Sample run (invented tenant `ws-sample/env-sample`, example images; output not committed):

    npx tsx deploy/zenith-managed/build/review-profile.ts profile.input.json \
      deploy/zenith-managed/build/profiles/zenith-build-seccomp.json \
      deploy/zenith-managed/build/profiles/zenith-build.apparmor \
      deploy/zenith-managed/build/profiles/zenith-build-gvisor.runtimeclass.json profile.json
    {"tenant":"cea14098...","runtimeProfileDigest":"897374eb4b9c19774a93cd50f56b07603968e066051bc3c8dc1b8097fe88db6e","reviewedBuildProfileDigest":"e1f83ea0...00c4"}

- `config.nodeIsolation.profileDigest` = `897374eb...db6e` (tenant-independent). The node label `zenith.node-restriction.kubernetes.io/build-profile` takes its first 63 characters.
- `reviewedBuildProfileDigest` covers the whole tenant profile (cluster, credentials, images, proxy), so it differs per tenant and is computed at provisioning.
- Fixed config values: `runtimeClass: "zenith-build-gvisor"`, `seccompProfile: "zenith-build.json"`, `appArmorProfile: "zenith-build"`.
- `ZENITH_ISOLATED_BUILD_PROFILES` = a JSON array, one object per workspace, environment and provider: `workspaceId`, `environmentId`, `provider`, `server`, `credentialRef`, `verifierCredentialRef`, optional `caData`/`registryRepositoryRoot`, and `config` (the output of `review-profile.ts`). Namespaces must be `zb-<key>` and `zp-<key>`.
- The hashes above are the final approved hashes, of the files as committed with the banners removed.

## How to approve
Reply "approve", or name changes (for example a syscall to add or remove, the gVisor-versus-runc choice, or a split AppArmor profile).

## Tested after approval
1. `review-profile.ts` on the final bytes; existing profile tests and the J6 build contract tests.
2. On a Linux node with AppArmor (not this Mac): `apparmor_parser -Q` on the profile, load the seccomp file through kubelet, apply the RuntimeClass.
3. J6 steps in PROD-LIFE-09: the isolation probe (21 checks since 2026-10-23, including the negative probes below), then a real source build, plus negative probes that a build step cannot call `ptrace`/`bpf`/`keyctl`, open raw sockets or write `/proc/sys`.
4. Revoke one precondition at a time and confirm the refusal.

## Open questions
- Does the verifier's node (Docker Desktop kind) have AppArmor enabled? Docker Desktop's VM may not (not checked), in which case kubelet refuses the pod and the AppArmor lane is blocked.
- Which BuildKit rootless version? The repo only uses the mutable tag `moby/buildkit:rootless`, resolved at verification. I did not check the profiles against a specific version.
- gVisor or runc, per the caveat above.
- Not checked in this environment: AppArmor syntax, seccomp loading, and every runtime behaviour above (no Linux node, no `apparmor_parser`).

## Findings from the hosted DRV-1 run (2026-10-23)
Hosted `drv1-private-source` on ubuntu-24.04-arm (kind, containerd, gVisor `release-20260928.0`, Calico v3.33.0).
- AppArmor: kind nodes do not mount securityfs, so kubelet refused the Localhost profile as unsupported. The DRV-1 fixture now mounts it and requires `zenith-build (enforce)` to be visible. After that, kubelet admitted the pod (run `39880088648`).
- gVisor with `hostUsers: false` fails. Every probe sandbox failed with
  `cannot create gofer process: gofer: error setting namespace of type user and path ".../pinned-namespaces/user": invalid argument`
  (run `39885437619`, source `27fbb5a2`). runsc cannot join the user namespace that containerd pins for the pod, so no build or probe container ever started under gVisor. This answers the "gVisor or runc" question for this release: gVisor and the mandatory outer pod user namespace cannot be combined.
- Not changed: the RuntimeClass, the profile digest, and the approved declaration. Changing the runtime changes the reviewed profile digest, so the owner must approve it again.

## runc fallback for disposable build verification (owner decision 2026-10-23)

Owner decision: runc is approved for **disposable build verification only**, on dedicated ephemeral single-tenant build
hosts, because gVisor cannot join the `hostUsers: false` pod user namespace (run `39885437619`). It is not an approval for
production or shared-tenant build isolation, and tenant runtime keeps gVisor (`zenith-gvisor`, J14) unchanged.

What changes:
- New RuntimeClass `zenith-build-runc` (`deploy/zenith-managed/build/profiles/zenith-build-runc.runtimeclass.json`):
  handler `runc` (containerd's stock `io.containerd.runc.v2` in the kind node), node selector
  `zenith.dev/build-runtime=runc`, no overhead block.
- Runtime profile digest, recomputed with `review-profile.ts`'s method over seccomp, AppArmor and the runtime manifest:
  `559c41027d4793561f860cc1ab5aaebd8dab04a2766a26961973ba1f1151de47`. The same method reproduces the approved gVisor
  digest `897374eb…db6e`, so only the runtime manifest changed.
- `scripts/release/drivers/drv1-isolation.ts`: `DRV1_RUNTIME=runc|gvisor` (default `gvisor`). runc skips the runsc
  install, requires kind's runc handler, labels the nodes for the runc class and creates it. Everything else is the same
  code path.
- `operated-gate-linux.yml` (`drv1-private-source`): `DRV1_RUNTIME=runc`, declaration `runtimeClass: zenith-build-runc`,
  `profileDigest: 559c4102…de47`; the gVisor archive download is removed from this lane.

What does not change: rootless BuildKit; `hostUsers: false`; the `zenith-build` seccomp profile and AppArmor profile
(loaded into the runner kernel); default-deny NetworkPolicy with the pinned egress proxy as the only route; resource
limits; `privileged: false`; the admission checks; the pod-level isolation probe, now 21 checks including the
negative probes the J6 plan listed. Each attempts a real operation an unconfined process could perform and must be
refused: `ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME)`, creating a one-entry BPF array map, `keyctl` get-session-keyring, a raw ICMP
socket, and opening `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname` for writing (`builder.go`). They run twice:
  - in the builder process before any source is read, where only the reviewed profile applies: `ptrace` must return
    EPERM (an unconfined `PTRACE_TRACEME` succeeds) and `keyctl` must return ENOSYS (the profile's own errno, which the
    kernel never returns for `keyctl`), so these two prove the zenith-build filter itself. `bpf`, raw sockets and
    `/proc/sys` are also refused by the dropped capabilities and file permissions, so they show defence in depth, not
    the filter alone;
  - inside an untrusted `RUN` step of the probe build (`exec-probe`), where all five must be refused or the probe build
    fails; BuildKit stacks its own filter there, so any refusal counts.
  In a plain Docker container (root, Docker's default profile) `ptrace` and the raw socket succeed and `keyctl` returns
  EPERM rather than ENOSYS, so both checks fail there. The build container keeps the
capabilities the 2026-10-21 approval already allows for rootless BuildKit and nothing more: all dropped, then
`SETUID` and `SETGID` added for the UID helpers, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true` (setuid helpers inside the pod user
namespace), `procMount: Unmasked`, and `sys_admin` allowed by the AppArmor profile for mounts inside the nested
namespace (`src/lib/providers/kubernetes/build/render.ts:62`, `zenith-build.apparmor`). The build pod carries no cloud
credentials; its only authority is the run's source secret and the local registry (no push secret in this lane).

Enforcement is now measured, not assumed (security review, 2026-10-23):
- Two probe checks read the kernel's view inside the probe container: `seccompEnforced` (`Seccomp: 2` in
  `/proc/self/status`) and `appArmorEnforced` (`zenith-build (enforce)` in `/proc/self/attr/apparmor/current` or
  `/proc/self/attr/current`). Admission requires every check (`PROBE_CHECKS` in `admission.ts`).
- The readback inspects the build and probe containers through containerd's CRI on the dedicated worker
  (`crictl inspect`) and requires the `zenith-build` AppArmor profile, the Localhost seccomp filter
  (`SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` default with its syscall list), a bounding set of only `CAP_SETUID`/`CAP_SETGID`, and a non-root
  user-namespace mapping (`scripts/release/drivers/source-build-readback.ts`, `assertNodeRuntimeSpec`).
- `registryDirectDenied` no longer passes when its probe endpoint is unset.

Residual risk accepted for this scope:
- With runc the build shares the runner's kernel. The seccomp profile allows `clone`/`unshare` (including
  `CLONE_NEWUSER`) and mount calls for rootless BuildKit, the AppArmor profile allows `sys_admin` inside the nested
  namespace, and `procMount: Unmasked` lifts the runtime's `/proc` masking (the AppArmor profile still denies writes
  under `/proc/sys`, `/sys` and `/proc/sysrq-trigger`). A kernel escape is not contained by a user-space kernel.
- kind node containers are themselves privileged Docker containers on the runner (kind's design, not checked here),
  so a build-pod escape that also escapes the node container reaches the runner VM.
- The runner is not empty: the same job runs a disposable J1 control-plane stack with per-run random secrets
  (`scripts/acceptance/default-stack/up.mjs`), and the build worker node is joined to that stack's network
  (`source-build-fixture.ts`). An escape could reach that disposable stack. It holds no cloud credentials, customer
  workload or reusable secret, and is destroyed with the VM.
- Runner single-tenancy and destruction are GitHub-hosted runner properties, not something this repository verifies.
- Restricted egress applies to the build: the build pod reaches only the pinned egress proxy and its allowlisted
  registry (Calico default-deny, proven by the `directEgressDenied`, `metadataDenied`, `credentialsEndpointDenied`,
  `proxyDenied` and `registryDirectDenied` probes). The runner VM and the kind node containers keep normal internet
  egress, which they need to pull pinned images; untrusted build code never runs there.
- The seccomp check compares the default action and the set of allowed system-call names with the reviewed file;
  argument conditions on individual rules are not compared. The node copy of the profile is hash-checked at install.
Execution is therefore limited to a fresh GitHub-hosted runner VM created for the run and destroyed afterwards, and the
driver checks it: `DRV1_RUNTIME=runc` is refused unless `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` and `RUNNER_ENVIRONMENT=github-hosted`
(an environment check against misconfiguration, not an authorization boundary). The self-hosted `drv1-private-source`
job in `ci.yml` never invokes this driver, so it cannot reach the runc path.

Required before execution: an independent security review of this change (recorded below). Production build isolation
needs its own demonstrated security acceptance.
