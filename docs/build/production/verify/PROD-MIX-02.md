# PROD-MIX-02: Parent and immutable child plans


## L3 live and operational verification (2026-10-08)

Acceptance contract: Dependency-ordered child workflows have immutable subplans, parent approval/evidence and durable receipts; stable resource addresses survive resume.

Profile: **mixed**. The owner observation matrix in [LIVE-ACCEPTANCE-MANAGED.md](../LIVE-ACCEPTANCE-MANAGED.md) maps every clause above to real product receipts, provider reads and traffic or operational observations. Fill distinct checks for every clause; a generic operation-status assertion is insufficient.

Implementation: `scripts/acceptance/live/managed/{plan,runner,transport,cli}.ts`, `scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/probes.ts`, the profile shell entry point. Offline checks: `tests/acceptance/live-managed.test.ts`, `tests/acceptance/live-managed-transports.test.ts`; actual Mac owner-gated checks: `tests/acceptance/live-l3.gated.test.ts`. No library injection replaces the CLI transport.

Mac prerequisites: Node 22; clean committed integrated RC; running owner-operated disposable Zenith/PostgreSQL/Temporal stack; managed cloud/CNI/runtime and two tenants for managed isolation; exact sandbox accounts/regions/real DNS/ACME/registry/Stripe test mode/private source fixtures as applicable. The shared runbook lists exact accounts, credentials as FILE references, and separate DEC-CLOUD, DEC-BUSINESS, DEC-RETENTION and signing/signoff approvals. For the lean 8 GB Mac/4 GiB Docker profile, observe an already operated remote sandbox; local cluster/engine rehearsals run one heavy process at a time after J1/J11/J14 integration.

Exact Mac commands, after owner has prepared the private recipe, permissions and approval FILEs described in the shared runbook:

```bash
bash scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/acceptance.sh --plan --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.recipe.json"
export ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/permissions.json"
npx tsx scripts/release/permissions-cli.ts check
export ZENITH_L3_APPROVAL_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.approval.json"
export ZENITH_L3_BUDGET_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/budget.json"
export ZENITH_L3_OUT="$PWD/.data-live/l3"
ZENITH_LIVE_MIXED=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/acceptance.sh --run --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.recipe.json"
# On interruption: audit the original journal/lock, then cleanup only with the same RC and approvals.
ZENITH_LIVE_MIXED=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/acceptance.sh --cleanup-only --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/mixed.recipe.json"
```

Expected: --plan opens no credential and makes zero calls; --run exits 0 only when every required profile scenario, actual assertion, approved cleanup and independent inventory passed. Exit 1 is a failed check, 2 refusal, 3 incomplete/cleanup-only. Live vitest alternative is in the shared runbook; all three live tests explicitly skip when their gates are disabled. Never count those skips as acceptance passes.

Not run here: cloud, real PostgreSQL, Temporal, Docker/kind, browser and operated-stack rehearsals. This row remains pending live/operational evidence and applicable owner decisions. Do not interpret generic tag-index scans as proof of all global/untaggable/unsupported resources being gone. Add direct provider-specific inventories from L1/L2 and review the actual observation matrix before accepting the ledger clause.

Integration joins: exact managed/release grants are absent from the shipped unapproved permissions.json; owner/integrator approval required before any live call. Use the original normal browser approval paths for all execution/teardown. Share the conservative budget book with L1/L2; connect J1/J2/J4/J5/J6/J11/J14/J15 receipt producers and J12 dossier/signoff. No platform migrations, aggregate SQL, package or published migration edits in this job.

Suggested ledger status: `implementation_complete_verification_pending` (L3 harness built; requirement verification and unresolved owner decisions remain pending).
