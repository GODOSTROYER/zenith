# PROD-OPS-05: Purpose-separated key custody

## L1-LIVE-AWS provider slice (8 October 2026)

Acceptance: Production signing and vault/result/Temporal encryption rotation retain decrypt-only histories with separated purposes and safe operator codec diagnostics.

The AWS planner includes this exact requirement; native provider fixture checks alone leave its full product acceptance pending. See [L1-LIVE-AWS](L1-LIVE-AWS.md) and [owner runbook](../LIVE-ACCEPTANCE.md) for the immutable plan, Wave 5 ProductScenarioPort join, approved permission/session FILE references, owner-only bootstrap, one-command execution and recovery. Commercial, retention, multi-cloud, managed cluster and final signoff decisions remain separate where this row requires them.

Exact Mac commands (Node 22, one workload, Docker 4GiB only for the separate Wave 5 stack):

```bash
export PATH="$ZENITH_NODE22_BIN:$PATH"
node --version
actionlint .github/workflows/live-acceptance.yml
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws init -backend=false
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws validate
npx vitest run tests/acceptance/aws-production.test.ts tests/acceptance/aws-production.live.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
# Only AFTER DEC-CLOUD and all variables in LIVE-ACCEPTANCE.md are exported, for a NEW approved run:
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS=1 npx vitest run tests/acceptance/aws-production.live.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
```

Expected offline: provider contracts pass; actual AWS test is skipped, never accepted as live evidence. Expected live for this source: six actual provider fixtures and native cleanup, zero failed checks, packet incomplete / exit 3 and this requirement pending until its full product journey is joined and independently verified. No actual AWS, real PostgreSQL, Temporal, kind or browser verification was run on the Windows builder. Status for the AWS harness slice: implementation_complete_verification_pending.

## L3 live and operational verification (2026-10-08)

Acceptance contract: Production signing and vault/result/Temporal encryption rotation retain decrypt-only histories with separated purposes and safe operator codec diagnostics.

Profile: **release**. The owner observation matrix in [LIVE-ACCEPTANCE-MANAGED.md](../LIVE-ACCEPTANCE-MANAGED.md) maps every clause above to real product receipts, provider reads and traffic or operational observations. Fill distinct checks for every clause; a generic operation-status assertion is insufficient.

Implementation: `scripts/acceptance/live/managed/{plan,runner,transport,cli}.ts`, `scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/probes.ts`, the profile shell entry point. Offline checks: `tests/acceptance/live-managed.test.ts`, `tests/acceptance/live-managed-transports.test.ts`; actual Mac owner-gated checks: `tests/acceptance/live-l3.gated.test.ts`. No library injection replaces the CLI transport.

Mac prerequisites: Node 22; clean committed integrated RC; running owner-operated disposable Zenith/PostgreSQL/Temporal stack; managed cloud/CNI/runtime and two tenants for managed isolation; exact sandbox accounts/regions/real DNS/ACME/registry/Stripe test mode/private source fixtures as applicable. The shared runbook lists exact accounts, credentials as FILE references, and separate DEC-CLOUD, DEC-BUSINESS, DEC-RETENTION and signing/signoff approvals. For the lean 8 GB Mac/4 GiB Docker profile, observe an already operated remote sandbox; local cluster/engine rehearsals run one heavy process at a time after J1/J11/J14 integration.

Exact Mac commands, after owner has prepared the private recipe, permissions and approval FILEs described in the shared runbook:

```bash
bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --plan --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
export ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/permissions.json"
npx tsx scripts/release/permissions-cli.ts check
export ZENITH_L3_APPROVAL_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/release.approval.json"
export ZENITH_L3_BUDGET_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/budget.json"
export ZENITH_L3_OUT="$PWD/.data-live/l3"
ZENITH_LIVE_RELEASE=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --run --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
# On interruption: audit the original journal/lock, then cleanup only with the same RC and approvals.
ZENITH_LIVE_RELEASE=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --cleanup-only --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
```

Expected: --plan opens no credential and makes zero calls; --run exits 0 only when every required profile scenario, actual assertion, approved cleanup and independent inventory passed. Exit 1 is a failed check, 2 refusal, 3 incomplete/cleanup-only. Live vitest alternative is in the shared runbook; all three live tests explicitly skip when their gates are disabled. Never count those skips as acceptance passes.

Not run here: cloud, real PostgreSQL, Temporal, Docker/kind, browser and operated-stack rehearsals. This row remains pending live/operational evidence and applicable owner decisions. Do not interpret generic tag-index scans as proof of all global/untaggable/unsupported resources being gone. Add direct provider-specific inventories from L1/L2 and review the actual observation matrix before accepting the ledger clause.

Integration joins: exact managed/release grants are absent from the shipped unapproved permissions.json; owner/integrator approval required before any live call. Use the original normal browser approval paths for all execution/teardown. Share the conservative budget book with L1/L2; connect J1/J2/J4/J5/J6/J11/J14/J15 receipt producers and J12 dossier/signoff. No platform migrations, aggregate SQL, package or published migration edits in this job.

Suggested ledger status: `implementation_complete_verification_pending` (L3 harness built; requirement verification and unresolved owner decisions remain pending).
