# PROD-OPS-05: Purpose-separated key custody

## L1-LIVE-AWS provider slice (8 October 2026)

Acceptance: Production signing and vault/result/Temporal encryption rotation retain decrypt-only histories with separated purposes and safe operator codec diagnostics.

The AWS planner includes this exact requirement; native provider fixture checks alone leave its full product acceptance pending. See [L1-LIVE-AWS](L1-LIVE-AWS.md) and [owner runbook](../LIVE-ACCEPTANCE.md) for the immutable plan, Wave 5 ProductScenarioPort join, approved permission/session FILE references, owner-only bootstrap, one-command execution and recovery. Commercial, retention, multi-cloud, managed cluster and final signoff decisions remain separate where this row requires them.

Exact Mac commands (Node 22, one workload, Docker 4GiB only for the separate Wave 5 stack):

```bash
export PATH="$ZENITH_NODE22_BIN:$PATH"
node --version
actionlint .github/workflows/live-acceptance.yml
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws init -backend=false
tofu -chdir=deploy/live-sandbox/aws validate
npx vitest run tests/acceptance/aws-production.test.ts tests/acceptance/aws-production.live.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
# Only AFTER DEC-CLOUD and all variables in LIVE-ACCEPTANCE.md are exported, for a NEW approved run:
ZENITH_LIVE_AWS=1 npx vitest run tests/acceptance/aws-production.live.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
```

Expected offline: provider contracts pass; actual AWS test is skipped, never accepted as live evidence. Expected live for this source: six actual provider fixtures and native cleanup, zero failed checks, packet incomplete / exit 3 and this requirement pending until its full product journey is joined and independently verified. No actual AWS, real PostgreSQL, Temporal, kind or browser verification was run on the Windows builder. Status for the AWS harness slice: implementation_complete_verification_pending.

## L3 live and operational verification (2026-10-08)

Acceptance contract: Production signing and vault/result/Temporal encryption rotation retain decrypt-only histories with separated purposes and safe operator codec diagnostics.

Profile: **release**. The owner observation matrix in [LIVE-ACCEPTANCE-MANAGED.md](../LIVE-ACCEPTANCE-MANAGED.md) maps every clause above to real product receipts, provider reads and traffic or operational observations. Fill distinct checks for every clause; a generic operation-status assertion is insufficient.

Implementation: `scripts/acceptance/live/managed/{plan,runner,transport,cli}.ts`, `scripts/acceptance/live/mixed/probes.ts`, the profile shell entry point. Offline checks: `tests/acceptance/live-managed.test.ts`, `tests/acceptance/live-managed-transports.test.ts`; actual Mac owner-gated checks: `tests/acceptance/live-l3.gated.test.ts`. No library injection replaces the CLI transport.

Mac prerequisites: Node 22; clean committed integrated RC; running owner-operated disposable Zenith/PostgreSQL/Temporal stack; managed cloud/CNI/runtime and two tenants for managed isolation; exact sandbox accounts/regions/real DNS/ACME/registry/Stripe test mode/private source fixtures as applicable. The shared runbook lists exact accounts, credentials as FILE references, and separate DEC-CLOUD, DEC-BUSINESS, DEC-RETENTION and signing/signoff approvals. For the lean 8 GB Mac/4 GiB Docker profile, observe an already operated remote sandbox; local cluster/engine rehearsals run one heavy process at a time after J1/J11/J14 integration.

Exact Mac commands, after owner has prepared the private recipe, permissions and approval FILEs described in the shared runbook:

```bash
bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --plan --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
export ZENITH_LIVE_SCOPE_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/permissions.json"
npx tsx scripts/release/permissions-cli.ts check
export ZENITH_L3_APPROVAL_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/release.approval.json"
export ZENITH_L3_BUDGET_FILE="$L3_PRIVATE/budget.json"
export ZENITH_L3_OUT="$PWD/.data-live/l3"
ZENITH_LIVE_RELEASE=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --run --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
# On interruption: audit the original journal/lock, then cleanup only with the same RC and approvals.
ZENITH_LIVE_RELEASE=1 bash scripts/acceptance/live/release/acceptance.sh --cleanup-only --fixture "$L3_PRIVATE/release.recipe.json"
```

Expected: --plan opens no credential and makes zero calls; --run exits 0 only when every required profile scenario, actual assertion, approved cleanup and independent inventory passed. Exit 1 is a failed check, 2 refusal, 3 incomplete/cleanup-only. Live vitest alternative is in the shared runbook; all three live tests explicitly skip when their gates are disabled. Never count those skips as acceptance passes.

Not run here: cloud, real PostgreSQL, Temporal, Docker/kind, browser and operated-stack rehearsals. This row remains pending live/operational evidence and applicable owner decisions. Do not interpret generic tag-index scans as proof of all global/untaggable/unsupported resources being gone. Add direct provider-specific inventories from L1/L2 and review the actual observation matrix before accepting the ledger clause.

Integration joins: exact managed/release grants are absent from the shipped unapproved permissions.json; owner/integrator approval required before any live call. Use the original normal browser approval paths for all execution/teardown. Share the conservative budget book with L1/L2; connect J1/J2/J4/J5/J6/J11/J14/J15 receipt producers and J12 dossier/signoff. No platform migrations, aggregate SQL, package or published migration edits in this job.

Suggested ledger status: `implementation_complete_verification_pending` (L3 harness built; requirement verification and unresolved owner decisions remain pending).


## Wave 6 final integration

Status remains `implementation_complete_verification_pending`. Node 22 only. Execute sequentially with Docker Desktop 4 GiB and one kind node; stop each heavy profile before starting another. Live acceptance stays deferred until separate owner approval.

```bash
node scripts/ci/wave6-gates.mjs --requirement PROD-OPS-05 --print > /tmp/zenith-wave6-PROD-OPS-05.commands.json
```

This prints the exact argv for each contract batch and required engine case, its gate names, private prerequisites, and its strict report-validation command. Set only the gates for the selected lane after preparing its owned fixture; a skip cannot satisfy that lane. Run each `argv` sequentially and then its `verify` argv. [Final integration setup and results](FINAL-INTEGRATION.md), [canonical inventory](../../../../scripts/ci/wave6-gates.json), [owner live runbook](../LIVE-ACCEPTANCE.md).

## OPS-05 key rotation on the live AWS sandbox (2026-10-30)

Run [41033090300](https://github.com/saivedant169/zenith/actions/runs/41033090300), run id `zlive-202610300923-d381`, workflow `live-acceptance.yml`, scenario `ops-05`, lane `live2`. Source `e4fd12e0e054a850f5db9bae7a1555fef1fecd8c`. Sandbox account `361646636162` in ap-south-1. Plan digest `cfc6e1169b6623478357294370eb20a4e50be5305eda19ba1eb2842507fd9b6a`; permission digest `b4a7d01b711ecc7f4f9d0afb37f5bab2d510d6fbc6d730d622347d7ddd72d8c6`.

Verdict `passed`: 1 passed, 0 failed, 0 pending. Cleanup complete. Estimated cap USD 0.75 (provisional, billing not measured), 50 minute window. Files: `evidence/PROD-OPS-05/2026-10-30-live-aws-41033090300/`.

What it proved:

- One vault secret and one managed S3 bucket were created under the installation's first keys.
- `installation.mjs rotate` rotated every generated key (7 purposes). The API and worker were removed and recreated together from the rotated env files.
- `key-custody diagnose` showed a new current key per purpose, with the old one kept decrypt-only (encryption) or verify-only (signing). There was no error finding, and Temporal and results each had their own root.
- The first deploy's Temporal history (123 payloads) needed only the now decrypt-only Temporal key, and every payload decrypted (`codec --verify`: 123 ok).
- The AWS connection still verified. A second bucket deployed under the new keys, and its history used only the new Temporal key.
- `key-custody rewrap --run` completed the vault re-wrap (1 secret re-sealed under the new vault key).
- No operator command output contained any key value, old or new.

Fixes that led here: PR #116 added `installation.mjs rotate` and the scenario. The first run (41026192545) died at the re-wrap: `rewrap --run` returned its run unawaited inside `try/finally`, so the store closed mid-run. PR #117 awaits it; that also fixes the operator CLI.

Limits: `operational_rehearsal` is not done, and the requirement lists it as required. This is one installation with S3 buckets on one provider. `evidence.json` is not a `zenith.release-evidence.v1` receipt. Status stays `in_progress`. Not a promotion.

## Contract and local engine receipts at the live run's commit (2026-11-01)

Source `e4fd12e0`, the commit of this requirement's `live_sandbox` receipt, so the levels share one commit. Each lane ran on a clean detached checkout of that commit through `scripts/release/lane-source.mjs`, on a Mac mini (Darwin arm64) with Node 22.23.3. `scripts/release/evidence-cli.mjs` bound a `zenith.release-evidence.v1` receipt to each source.

- `contract`: 60 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped over 7 test files, offline, no engine or network. Files: `docs/build/production/evidence/PROD-OPS-05/2026-11-01-contract-e4fd12e0/`.
- `local_engine`: 57 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped over 1 test files, against a disposable PostgreSQL 16.15 (pinned digest) migrated by the checkout's own migrator. Files: `docs/build/production/evidence/PROD-OPS-05/2026-11-01-local-engine-e4fd12e0/`.


`operational_rehearsal` is still not done. Not a promotion.
