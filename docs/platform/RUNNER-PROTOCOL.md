# Runner and zenithd wire protocol — v1

Two outbound-only agents speak to the Zenith control plane:

| Agent | Protocol id | Runs where | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zenith-runner` | `zenith.runner/v1` | customer cloud/network (container, Helm, binary) | executes signed jobs with the customer's **local workload identity**: OpenTofu, an AWS SigV4 signing proxy, a Kubernetes API proxy, network probes |
| `zenithd` | `zenith.machine/v1` | on a Linux VM | executes signed **semantic machine operations** (inspect, service status/restart, container logs, bounded reads, checks); `machine.exec` only when locally enabled |

Neither agent accepts inbound connections. Neither ever receives cloud master
credentials, model credentials, or Zenith database access. Cloud credentials
used by the runner never leave the customer environment.

Both are Go, one module at `go/` (`go/cmd/zenith-runner`, `go/cmd/zenithd`),
static binaries (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), Linux first.

## 1. Keys and identities

| Key | Holder | Algorithm | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| control-plane signing key | Zenith control plane (`ZENITH_CONTROL_SIGNING_JWK`, private Ed25519 JWK; KMS-backed in production) | EdDSA (Ed25519) | signs job envelopes (`typ: zenith-job+jwt`), machine requests (`typ: zenith-machine+jwt`) and capability grants (`typ: zenith-grant+jwt`) |
| agent identity key | each runner / zenithd, generated locally at registration, never leaves the host | Ed25519 | signs every HTTP request the agent makes |
| OIDC issuer key | control plane (`ZENITH_OIDC_SIGNING_JWK`, RSA) | RS256 | cloud workload-identity federation only; never used by these agents |

The agent pins the control-plane public key (and `kid`) returned at
registration. A key rotation is announced in heartbeat responses
(`nextKeys`) at least 24 hours before use.

## 2. Registration

1. An admin creates a registration token in Zenith (single use, ≤ 1 hour,
   shown once, stored only as SHA-256). The token names the workspace and the
   agent kind (`runner` | `machine`) and, for machines, an optional
   environment/resource binding.
2. The agent generates an Ed25519 key pair and calls
   `POST /api/platform/v1/{runners|machines}/register`:
   ```json
   { "token": "zrt_…", "publicKey": "<base64url raw 32 bytes>", "name": "prod-vpc-runner",
     "version": "1.0.0", "capabilities": ["tofu.run", "aws.http", "probe.http"], "labels": {"region":"ap-south-1"},
     "host": {"os":"linux","arch":"amd64"} }
   ```
3. Response:
   ```json
   { "id": "run_…", "workspaceId": "…", "controlPlaneKeys": [{"kid":"cp-2026-09","publicKey":"<base64url>"}],
     "pollIntervalSec": 5, "protocol": "zenith.runner/v1" }
   ```
   The token is consumed in the same transaction that creates the agent row.

## 3. Signed requests (agent → control plane)

Every request after registration carries:

```
X-Zenith-Agent:          <agent id>
X-Zenith-Timestamp:      <unix seconds>
X-Zenith-Nonce:          <16 random bytes, base64url>
X-Zenith-Content-SHA256: <hex sha256 of the exact body bytes; of "" for no body>
X-Zenith-Signature:      <base64url Ed25519 signature>
```

over the UTF-8 string (fields joined by `\n`, no trailing newline):

```
<protocol id>
<HTTP METHOD uppercase>
<path including query, exactly as sent>
<timestamp>
<nonce>
<content sha256 hex>
```

The server rejects: unknown or revoked agent (`401 agent_revoked` —
terminal, the agent stops), clock skew > 60 s, a nonce seen within the last
10 minutes for that agent, a body digest mismatch, a bad signature.

TLS: the agent always verifies the server certificate (system roots, or a
pinned CA via `tls.caFile`). Where the control plane terminates client-cert
mTLS (self-hosted), the agent presents `tls.clientCert/clientKey`. A control
plane on Vercel cannot terminate client-cert mTLS; there the request
signature above is the client authentication, and the docs say so.

## 4. Jobs (control plane → runner)

`POST /api/platform/v1/runners/{id}/poll` (signed, body `{"max":1,"waitSec":20}`,
long-poll ≤ 25 s) returns `{"jobs": ["<compact JWS>", …]}`.

Each job is a compact JWS, header `{"alg":"EdDSA","kid":"…","typ":"zenith-job+jwt"}`,
payload:

```json
{
  "protocol": "zenith.runner/v1",
  "jti": "job_…",
  "runnerId": "run_…",
  "workspaceId": "…",
  "operationId": "…",
  "capability": "infrastructure.apply",
  "kind": "tofu.run | aws.http | k8s.http | probe.http | probe.tcp | probe.dns",
  "payload": { },
  "grant": "<compact JWS capability grant>",
  "iat": 1790000000,
  "exp": 1790000300,
  "timeoutSec": 1800,
  "maxOutputBytes": 1048576
}
```

The runner verifies, in order, and rejects (reporting `rejected` with a
reason) on any failure: signature with a pinned key; `typ`; `runnerId` is
itself; `iat`/`exp` (skew 60 s); `jti` unseen (persisted replay cache,
retained ≥ 24 h); `kind` enabled in local config; the embedded grant's
signature, `exp`, `aud == "runner:<id>"`, `cap == capability`, `op ==
operationId`; the payload schema; kind-specific allowlists (below).

Results: `POST /api/platform/v1/runners/{id}/jobs/{jti}/result` (signed):

```json
{ "status": "succeeded | failed | rejected | timed_out", "startedAt": "…", "finishedAt": "…",
  "exitCode": 0, "result": { }, "error": "…" }
```

Logs (optional, streamed): `POST …/jobs/{jti}/logs` with
`{"seq": n, "lines": [{"ts":"…","stream":"stdout|stderr|info","line":"…"}]}`,
≤ 64 KiB per call, redacted by the runner for credential patterns.

The control plane accepts exactly one result per job (first writer wins,
conditional update); a duplicate returns `409 already_settled`.

### Job kinds

**`tofu.run`** — payload `{ "command": "plan|apply|show", "files": [{"path","contentB64"}],
"lockfile": "…", "configDigest": "…", "planDigest": "…" }`. The runner
recomputes `configDigest` (same rule as `src/lib/tofu`: sha256 over sorted
`path\0sha256(content)\n`) and refuses a mismatch; runs its pinned OpenTofu
with `-lockfile=readonly` in a fresh temp dir; for `apply` it requires a plan
file it produced itself for the same `configDigest` and whose normalized
digest equals `planDigest`. Result: `{ exitCode, output (redacted, truncated),
planJson? }`.

**`aws.http`** — the SigV4 signing proxy. Payload `{ "service", "region", "method",
"url", "headers", "bodyB64" }` is an *unsigned* AWS API request serialized by
the control plane's AWS SDK. The runner: requires `https://` and a host
matching `*.amazonaws.com` / `*.amazonaws.com.cn` / `*.api.aws`; strips any
`Authorization`, `X-Amz-Security-Token`, `X-Amz-Date`; derives the action
(JSON protocol `X-Amz-Target`, query protocol `Action=`, REST protocols by
method+path pattern) and checks `service:Action` against the allowlist for
the job's capability; signs with the **local** credential chain; executes
with the job timeout; returns `{ status, headers (allowlisted), bodyB64 }`
capped at `maxOutputBytes`. It never returns its own credentials.

**`k8s.http`** — payload `{ "method", "path", "bodyB64", "contentType" }` against
the in-cluster API server with the runner's service-account token; allowlist
of verb + API group/resource per capability.

**`probe.http` / `probe.tcp` / `probe.dns`** — bounded checks. The runner
always refuses link-local and instance-metadata addresses
(`169.254.0.0/16`, `fd00:ec2::254`, `metadata.google.internal`).

## 5. Machine requests (control plane → zenithd)

Same registration, signing, polling (`/machines/{id}/poll`) and result
shapes, with `typ: zenith-machine+jwt` and payload:

```json
{ "protocol": "zenith.machine/v1", "jti": "mreq_…", "machineId": "mac_…", "workspaceId": "…",
  "operationId": "…", "operation": "service.status", "args": { "unit": "nginx.service" },
  "grant": "<JWS>", "iat": 0, "exp": 0, "timeoutSec": 30, "maxOutputBytes": 65536 }
```

zenithd implements each operation as fixed code — no shell string is ever
built from `args`:

| Operation | Implementation | Local guard |
|---|---|---|
| `machine.inspect` | os-release, uptime, load, memory, disks | — |
| `process.list` | `/proc` scan | — |
| `service.status` | `systemctl show <unit>` (argv, validated unit name) | unit name regex |
| `machine.service.restart` | `systemctl restart <unit>` | `services.restartAllow` list |
| `container.list/inspect/logs` | Docker Engine API over the unix socket | `containers.enabled` |
| `container.exec` | Docker exec | `exec.enabled` + grant |
| `file.read` | open + bounded read | `files.readAllow` path prefixes; no symlink escape |
| `network.portCheck` / `network.dnsCheck` | dial / resolver | metadata IPs refused |
| `system.metrics` | `/proc` | — |
| `system.logs` | `journalctl -u <unit> --since … -n …` (argv) | line cap |
| `machine.exec` | argv exec (`args.argv: string[]`, never a shell) | `exec.enabled: false` by default |

Every request, accepted or rejected, is appended to a local JSONL audit log
(`/var/lib/zenithd/audit.jsonl`, 0600) with the request id, operation, grant
id, outcome and output digest — never the output itself for `file.read`.

## 6. Heartbeat, revocation, reconnect

`POST /{runners|machines}/{id}/heartbeat` every 30 s with `{version, capabilities,
running, host}` → `{revoked, nextKeys?, pollIntervalSec}`. A `revoked: true`
response or `401 agent_revoked` on any call makes the agent stop taking
work, finish nothing further, and exit non-zero. Transient network errors
back off exponentially (1 s → 60 s, jittered) and resume; in-flight jobs keep
their own deadlines. The control plane marks an agent `stale` after 3 missed
heartbeats and never dispatches to it; a job whose runner goes silent past its
deadline becomes `uncertain` on the operation, never re-dispatched
automatically.

## 7. Versioning

The protocol id is in every signed string and every envelope. A breaking
change is `v2` with both served in parallel during migration; the control
plane refuses an agent whose protocol it does not speak with
`426 upgrade_required` naming the minimum version.
