# METADATA
# title: Deny rules
# description: |
#   Every rule in this package is a complete rule whose value is a reason
#   object `{code, message}`; the rule is defined (true) only when the request
#   must be denied. The decision aggregator (`zenith.decision`) iterates this
#   whole package, so each rule name is the stable identifier reported as
#   `zenith.rules.deny.<name>` in the decision's reasons.
#
#   Keep this package to reason rules only: helpers belong in `zenith.lib`.
#   Messages contain only static text, numbers and validated region names —
#   never resource addresses or other externally derived strings, because
#   reasons are shown to people and to models.
#
#   Any single deny wins over every approval requirement and over allow.
