/**
 * `Mix03Product` for the PROD-MIX-03 live scenario: the browser half of the product path, on the Zenith stack the workflow
 * started on this runner (ZENITH_DEFAULT_STACK_DIRECTORY and ZENITH_DEFAULT_MAILPIT_URL, exported by default-stack/env.mjs).
 *
 * It drives the product the way scripts/release/drivers/operated.ts does: the owner and a CI-created approver sign in for
 * real, enrol a TOTP authenticator, step up with it when a privileged route answers `mfa_required`, and the approver approves
 * in the browser. Every product call is a route or action the web app uses. The only non-product call is the test user
 * provisioning that operated.ts also does (the stack's Auth admin API creates two disposable users).
 *
 * proposeMixed drives the real planner: a sandbox parent environment holds the producer and consumer manifest (its simulated
 * deploy is the only parent revision the planner reads, and it creates no cloud resource), the producer and consumer are AWS
 * children on the run's connection, and each child gets its own deploy operation. issueOutputPreauthorization reads the plan's
 * digests and issues one precise use for the consumer; preauthorizationUses reads the parent's grants back. The one use is
 * reserved by the parent workflow itself (consumeOutputs) when the producer's output materializes for the consumer.
 * Evidence names the approver as the automated test approver; no credential, token or recovery link is returned.
 *
 * Seams: `request` (same-origin fetch in the page), `approve`, `stepUp`, `session` and `sleep`. Unit tests inject all of them.
