/**
 * ProductScenarioPort for PROD-MIX-03 (typed outputs between two AWS children on one connection), live sandbox.
 *
 * Zenith does the product work through the paths a person uses: connection.createAws and connection.verifyAws, the mixed
 * parent plan with explicit pins and one declared reference, the approvals, child starts, the producer change and the
 * one-use preauthorization. The browser work is `Mix03Product`. This port only (a) changes the sandbox trust for the run's
 * ExternalId through planned IAM calls, restoring it afterwards, and (b) reads the result back from AWS and checks it.
 * Product receipts and AWS readbacks decide; child output is never evidence.
 *
 * The driver is `browserMix03Product` (mix-03-driver.ts), which aws-live.ts wires when ZENITH_LIVE_PRODUCT=1. Callers that pass no
 * driver get `unwiredProduct`, which refuses before its first AWS call, so nothing is changed.
 * Cleanup is planned and runs in `finally`: it deletes only tagged resources that match exact name patterns, then re-lists
 * by tag. Anything left is returned as a leak, which the harness records as a failed check.
 *
 * The same run proves PROD-MIX-02 (parent and immutable child plans): the stored parent plan is read back after the proposal,
 * just before the execution worker is stopped (producer done, consumer waiting for its review) and at the end. The review is
 * approved while the worker is down, the worker is restarted and the parent resumes. Its digests, dependency order and stable
 * addresses must not change, every receipt must re-derive from its own fields, the producer's receipt must survive the restart
 * unchanged and AWS must still hold the same one producer bucket.
 *
 * Seams: `product` (browser driver), `worker`, `sleep` and the bounds for propagation and child polling. Tests inject all of them.
