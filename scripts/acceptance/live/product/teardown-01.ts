/**
 * ProductScenarioPort for TEARDOWN-01 (live sandbox): teardown after deploy, through the product's browser path.
 *
 * Zenith deploys one managed S3 bucket into a fresh AWS environment (two-person approval). The teardown review is then
 * refused while the deploy's earlier writers can still deliver (WP6), and becomes available once the execution worker has
 * settled them (WP3: about 80 minutes after the deploy's last write grant). The run then refreshes its one-hour OIDC session,
 * tears the environment down through env.reviewTeardown and every browser approval of the destroy, and reads back
 * independently that the recorded state holds no resource and no resource tagged with the environment remains.
 *
 * This port only (a) points the sandbox roles' trust at the run's ExternalId and restores it, (b) reads the environment's
 * recorded OpenTofu state as the connection's deploy role and the tagging inventory, and (c) cleans up with the recorded state
 * when the product teardown did not finish.
