/**
 * Check that `package-lock.json` can only ever install what the public npm
 * registry published — the deterministic half of the `supply-chain` job in
 * .github/workflows/ci.yml.
 *
 * ## The attack this is cheap insurance against
 *
 * `npm ci` installs exactly what the lockfile says, from wherever the lockfile
 * says. A pull request that edits the lockfile by hand — or a tool that
 * "helpfully" rewrites it — can point one package at a different host, an
 * `http://` URL, a git ref, a local path, or drop its `integrity` hash so the
 * tarball is not verified at all. None of that is visible in a review of
 * `package.json`, and a 900-entry lockfile diff is not something a human
 * reads. So this reads every entry and requires, for each one:
 *
 *   - `resolved` is an `https://registry.npmjs.org/<name>/-/…tgz` URL, with no
 *     credentials, query string or fragment, and the path names the same
 *     package the lockfile entry does (a tarball of package B filed under
 *     package A is the shape a lockfile-level substitution takes);
 *   - `integrity` is a `sha512-` hash, so npm verifies the bytes it fetched;
 *   - it is not a `link` (a local-path dependency cannot be reproduced from
 *     the registry, and this repository has no workspaces).
 *
 * The one legitimate exception is a package with `inBundle: true`: it ships
 * inside its parent's tarball (six entries today, all under
 * `@tailwindcss/oxide-wasm32-wasi`) and so has neither field. Those are covered
 * by the parent's integrity hash.
 *
 * ## What this does not prove
 *
 * That the registry's tarball is benign — only that the lockfile pins bytes
 * from the registry. `npm audit` (the informational step next to this one)
 * speaks to known-vulnerable versions; nothing here speaks to a malicious
 * release nobody has reported. `npm ci --ignore-scripts` is what limits what a
 * bad tarball can do at install time.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/ci/lockfile-integrity.mjs [path/to/package-lock.json]
 * Exit:   0 every entry is registry-pinned and hashed, 1 otherwise.
