/**
 * Opt-in live check of the S3 backup target — a real round trip against a real
 * endpoint (LocalStack by default).
 *
 * Run:
 *   npm run localstack:up
 *   npx tsx --env-file-if-exists=.env.local scripts/hosted/backup-live-check.ts
 *   npx tsx scripts/hosted/backup-live-check.ts --bucket=zenith-backups --endpoint=http://localhost:4566 --create-bucket
 *
 * **This is a script, not a test, on purpose.** A test that skipped itself
 * when LocalStack was not running would report green for a code path nobody
 * exercised, and "the S3 target works" would end up resting on nothing. So the
 * automated suite covers `S3Target` against an injected client double — the
 * command shapes and the ETag guard — and this script is the only thing that
 * claims a live endpoint answered.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 every check passed, 1 a check failed, 2 the endpoint could not
 * be reached or the arguments were wrong.
 *
 * It writes objects under `live-check/<uuid>/` and leaves them there; the
 * `BackupTarget` contract has no delete, and inventing one for a diagnostic
 * would put a delete path in a module whose job is not losing data.
 *
 * **What it can and cannot establish.** It proves this endpoint accepted a
 * put, returned the same bytes, listed the key and appended two ledger lines.
 * The last check asks the one question that actually matters for the
 * revocation ledger: does this endpoint honour `If-Match`? An endpoint that
 * ignores it turns a guarded append into last-writer-wins, and two control
 * processes appending at once would lose a revocation. LocalStack Community
 * has historically been inconsistent here, which is exactly why the answer is
 * measured rather than assumed.
 *
 * Workstream W8 (hosted R3).
