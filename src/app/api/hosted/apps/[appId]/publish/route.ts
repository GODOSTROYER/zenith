/**
 * Publish a source package to an app.
 *
 * 202, not 200: the response means "this job exists and is durable", not "your
 * app is live". The job id is the client's, so the same request sent twice is
 * the same publish — and the same id with different content is refused rather
 * than joined to it. Both answers come from the job admission in the authority,
 * not from anything this route remembers.
