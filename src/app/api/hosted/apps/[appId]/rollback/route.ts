 * Put an app back onto a release it already ran.

 * A rollback is not a restore and this route will not pretend otherwise: it
 * changes which artifact serves and touches no record any user wrote. The
 * compatibility check between the target release's schema and the app's data
 * happens inside the job, before the pointer moves.
