/**
 * Alert rules: create, edit, delete, acknowledge.
 *
 * Every rule plan says the same three things, because they are the three things
 * an operator needs before trusting an alert: what is watched, how often it is
 * checked, and where it will show up. The third one is the honest one, and it
 * is now read from the workspace rather than asserted: a workspace with no
 * channels is told it is on-screen only, and one with channels is told exactly
 * which endpoints will receive the alert.
 *
 * Admin of WHICH workspace is the other half of that sentence, so every rule
 * and alert here is resolved with `scopedRule` / `scopedEvent` (see
 * @/lib/alerts) rather than a global finder: `runAction` only ever checks the
 * caller's role in `ctx.workspaceId`, so a lookup that reads the whole store
 * would let an admin of one workspace reach another workspace's rules. A
 * foreign id is refused with the same sentence as an id that never existed.
 *
 * Split out of the single-file module; the code is unchanged.
