/**
 * The MCP v3 tool catalog: names, descriptions, annotations, schema versions
 * and schema digests, with no handler code.
 *
 * `tools/list` is rendered from this file and so is docs/platform/MCP.md's
 * table, so there is exactly one place where a tool's contract is written.
 *
 * Annotations follow the MCP specification's hints and are conservative:
 *  - read tools are `readOnlyHint` and `idempotentHint`. The ones that reach a
 *    cloud or a workflow engine are also `openWorldHint`.
 *  - propose tools are NOT read-only (they write an operation row to Zenith's
 *    ledger) but they are not destructive (nothing outside Zenith changes) and
 *    are idempotent (their idempotency key makes a retry return the same
 *    operation).
 *  - the execute tool is the only one marked `destructiveHint`: it is what
 *    starts real work, and only ever for an approved, digest-matching operation.
 *
 * `schemaDigest` is `sha256:` + the control-plane digest (`controlplane/digest`)
 * of the canonical JSON Schema the client receives. It is computed from the
 * rendered schema, so a change to the zod definition that changes the contract
 * changes the digest; `schemaVersion` must be bumped with it (a golden test
 * fails otherwise).
