/**
 * MCP v3 public contract constants (docs/platform/MCP.md).
 *
 * Versioning, in one place:
 *
 *  - `CONTRACT_VERSION` is the version of the whole surface: the tool names,
 *    the result envelope, the error shape and the approval model. It changes
 *    only for a breaking change to any of those, and the endpoint path
 *    (`/api/agent/v3/mcp`) changes with it.
 *  - Every tool carries its own integer `schemaVersion` (bumped when its input
 *    contract changes) and a `schemaDigest`: sha256 of the canonical JSON
 *    Schema a client is handed in `tools/list`. A client that pins a digest
 *    learns about a contract change by a mismatch, not by a surprise refusal.
 *  - The digests are pinned by a golden test (tests/agent-v3/catalog.test.ts),
 *    so a schema edit that forgets to bump `schemaVersion` fails CI.
 *
 * Nothing in this file imports the product store, the broker or the MCP SDK,
 * so the catalog can be rendered (docs, SDK generators, tests) without them.
