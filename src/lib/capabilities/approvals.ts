/**
 * Approvals: human, digest-bound, expiring, single-use (ADR-0007).
 *
 * What makes an approval valid here, in the order it is checked:
 *
 *  1. The decider is a member of the workspace (a non-member gets `not_found`,
 *     the same answer as a foreign operation id).
 *  2. The decider is a plain HUMAN `user` principal AND presents a
 *     `BrowserSessionProof` for that same user. A model, an integration, the
 *     Navigator, a runner or a machine can never approve or reject — typed
 *     `approver_not_human`, and the attempt is written to the audit log.
 *  3. Role: at least the decision's `approval.minRole`; a viewer never decides.
 *  4. The operation is `awaiting_approval` and not expired.
 *  5. The digest the approver reviewed equals the operation's proposal digest.
 *  6. Separation of duties: when required, approver ≠ the requesting human
 *     (`principal.onBehalfOf ?? principal.id`).
 *  7. One decision per approver per round. A second approval by the same
 *     user is refused (`duplicate_decision`) and counts once.
 *  8. `count > 1` needs N DISTINCT approvers; the operation becomes `approved`
 *     only when the Nth lands.
 *  9. At a plan gate whose recorded review carries executable semantics (PROD-DUR-03),
 *     the approver must present the semantics digest they reviewed
 *     (`semantics_mismatch` otherwise). The approval is thereby bound to the recipe,
 *     scripts, migration class, targets, configuration, provider locks, backend and
 *     saved plan the plan view stands for, and every dispatch recomputes it.
 *
 * Steps 3–8 are enforced again by the store (`recordApproval` is the only path
 * to `approved`), so the database, not this function, is the last word.
 *
 * Approving also re-evaluates the proposal against CURRENT policy, roles and
 * autonomy. If policy now denies it, or now asks for a stricter approval than
 * the one the proposal was created under, the approval is refused
 * (`policy_denied` / `reapproval_required`) rather than recorded against a
 * requirement the approver was not shown. The approval records the policy
 * bundle version in force; execution re-validates again.
 *
 * REVOKING an approval before execution cancels the whole proposal: the
 * approval row cannot be un-written (history is append-only), and a proposal
 * whose approval was withdrawn must not remain approvable in a weaker form. A
 * fresh proposal is needed.
