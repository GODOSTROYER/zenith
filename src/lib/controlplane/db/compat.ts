/**
 * API N-1 / N schema compatibility contract (PROD-OPS-03).
 *
 * Rule: inside one release train, a platform migration is EXPAND-ONLY. The
 * previous release (N-1) keeps running against the migrated schema while the new
 * release (N) rolls out, and a rollback to N-1 after migration must still work. So
 * a migration may add tables, nullable or defaulted columns, indexes, unvalidated
 * constraints, enum values, functions and additive grants, and nothing else.
 *
 * Anything classified `contract` or `unclassified` by the LIFE-10 classifier
 * (src/lib/release-safety/classify.ts: drops, renames, type changes, NOT NULL on
 * existing columns, validated constraints, revokes, RLS changes on existing
 * tables) is a CONTRACT migration. It is refused by `migratePlatformDb` unless
 *   (a) it is registered in `CONTRACT_MIGRATION_APPROVALS` with the sha256 of its
 *       exact SQL and a LIFE-10 approval reference (the registry is code, so the
 *       approval is reviewed like code and any SQL edit voids it), and
 *   (b) the operator names its version in ZENITH_ALLOW_CONTRACT_MIGRATIONS at apply
 *       time, which is the statement that the previous release is fully drained.
 * Neither alone is enough.
 *
 * Statements that act on a table created in the SAME migration are exempt: no N-1
 * code can have seen that table, so e.g. `alter table <new> enable row level
 * security` is safe. The classifier is conservative text analysis, not a parser; an
 * unrecognised statement is `unclassified` and therefore refused.
 *
 * Baseline: migrations up to `compatBaseline()` are already in the previous release
 * and are grandfathered; the baseline is derived (live ledger at runtime, registry
 * or ZENITH_COMPAT_BASELINE_VERSION in CI), never a constant.
 *
 * Runtime direction: a build that finds the database AHEAD of it (a newer release
 * migrated) is allowed, which is what makes N-1 run against schema N
 * (`platformSchemaStatus().ahead`); an N build against schema N-1 fails closed with
 * `schema_behind` until the operator runs the migration step first (expand, then
 * roll out). See docs/platform/operations/ROLLING-UPGRADES.md.
