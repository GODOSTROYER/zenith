/**
 * Approved field-ownership transfers (PROD-LIFE-12).
 *
 * A transfer row is created in exactly one place: `recordForApprovedOperation`,
 * called by `approvals.record` in the SAME transaction that moves an operation
 * to `approved`. That path already proves a human user decided, on the exact
 * proposal digest. The transfers it records are the ones named in the stored
 * proposal (`proposal.broker.ownershipTransfers`), so an approver reviewed
 * precisely them; nothing a model or caller supplies later can add one.
 *
 * Every function filters on `workspace_id` in SQL; a foreign id is the same as
 * a missing one.
