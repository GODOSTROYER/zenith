/**
 * Recovery epochs and operator continuation (PROD-OPS-04).
 *
 * A restore rewinds the platform database to a point in time. What was single-use, monotonic or already
 * delivered after that point looks fresh again, while workers, Temporal histories and providers still remember
 * the timeline that was lost. The epoch is the fence that makes the rewind visible:
 *
 *  - `bumpRecoveryEpoch` (run once per restore, by the restore runbook with database credentials, never from a
 *    request path) appends the next epoch to the append-only `platform.recovery_epochs`. In the same transaction it
 *    - expires every lease and lifts every fence counter to the new epoch floor, so a pre-restore fence token can
 *      never equal a live fence;
 *    - turns every restored `running` operation into `uncertain` (the executor of the lost timeline is unknowable);
 *    - revokes every unconsumed capability grant and closes every non-terminal runner/zenithd job as not claimed
 *      (queued) or outcome unknown (claimed/running) so a restored envelope cannot be executed a second time;
 *    - turns every restored `claimed`/`dispatched` saved-plan use into `uncertain`;
 *    - turns every restored `pending` external effect into `uncertain` (the provider call may have been made after
 *      the backup), and leaves `accepted`, `uncertain` and `conflict` effects exactly as they are;
 *    - opens one `recovery_items` row for every operation, intent and effect that was in flight.
 *  - Every check that grants authority includes the epoch: approval consumption and counting, the execution claim,
 *    the approval record, intent claim and settle, start-intent adoption and approval-signal derivation, and every
 *    lease acquire (the fence token itself carries the epoch). A row stamped below the current epoch is refused or
 *    waits for a human.
 *  - `decideItem` is the continuation command. A person decides, bound to the exact subject they reviewed:
 *    `resume` reopens an operation with a FRESH approval round in the current epoch (the old approvals stay void),
 *    or re-stamps an intent; `abandon` cancels or supersedes it; `keep_uncertain` records that an uncertain
 *    operation or effect was seen and stays uncertain. Nothing resumes on a timer, and an uncertain effect is
 *    resolved only by the existing evidence-bound resolution (PROD-DUR-07), never here.
 *
 * Honest limit: work that happened AFTER the backup left no trace in the restored database (no operation, no
 * effect row). The epoch cannot replay it, and cannot see it. The runbook's RPO window and the provider
 * reconciliation it prescribes are the answer to that, not this module.
 *
 * Tenancy: `bumpRecoveryEpoch` is a system operation across every tenant by design (a restore is one event for the
 * whole database) and is listed as such in the verify document. Every other function names `workspace_id`.
