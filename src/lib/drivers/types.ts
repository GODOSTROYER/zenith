/**
 * Resource driver contract (spec §9, ADR-0004).
 *
 * A provider is a set of resource-oriented drivers, one per (provider, native
 * type) — never one switch statement. Each driver realizes one portable kind
 * on one provider and declares, honestly, which of its operations are real.
 *
 * Lifecycle split (ADR-0005, hybrid OpenTofu + native APIs):
 *   - Declarative lifecycle (create/update/delete of persistent
 *     infrastructure) is `compile()` → OpenTofu JSON. Drivers never hand-roll
 *     create/update/delete calls for anything OpenTofu manages.
 *   - Day-two operations (restart, scale-now, invoke, target health, log and
 *     metric queries, SSM) are native API calls in `operations`.
 *   - `observe`, `runtime`, `verify`, `discover` are native API reads.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - `observe`/`runtime`/`verify`/`discover` are read-only. They never
 *     create, mutate or delete, and they never return secret values.
 *   - An attribute the driver did not read is `{ state: "unknown" }`.
 *   - Every mutating native operation is idempotent where the provider allows
 *     it (client tokens / idempotency keys derived from the operation id) and
 *     carries the fence token in a request tag or token when the API has one.
 *   - Operations honour `ctx.signal` and stop promptly when it aborts.
 *   - Discovery returns candidates only; it never marks anything `managed`.
