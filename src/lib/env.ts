/**
 * Every `ZENITH_*` variable the server reads, in one validated place — plus
 * `SUPABASE_DB_URL`, which keeps Supabase's own name and is validated (never
 * read for its value) here alongside them.
 *
 * Before this module the 13 reads were scattered and ad-hoc: a typo in
 * `ZENITH_FAST` silently meant "slow", and `ZENITH_LLM_MODEL` — which decides
 * which model you pay for — was documented nowhere at all.
 *
 * Two deliberate exclusions:
 *
 *  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` (the Supabase keys) must stay as literal
 *    `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_…` expressions in `lib/supabase/env.ts`. Next
 *    inlines those at build time by matching the literal text; reading them
 *    through a function yields `undefined` in the browser bundle.
 *  - Provider credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`,
 *    `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) are presence-only flags here. Their values stay at
 *    their single call site, so this module never becomes somewhere a secret
 *    can be read from by accident.
 *
 * Read on every call rather than memoised: the scripts and the test suite
 * both set `ZENITH_DATA` at runtime before importing anything, and a cached
 * snapshot would silently ignore them. The ten raw values ARE re-read every
 * time; only the zod parse of an unchanged set of them is reused, so a
 * mid-process change is still picked up on the very next call.
