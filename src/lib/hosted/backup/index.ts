 *   crypto.ts   AES-256-GCM under ZENITH_BACKUP_KEY, and the key-id label
 *   bundle.ts   the ZBK1 container: a manifest and length-prefixed files
 *   create.ts   the WAL-safe snapshot of the authority and every app database
 *   restore.ts  clean-directory restore with revocation reconciliation
 *   reopen.ts   the deliberate second step, with real checks
 *
 * The one import for consumers: `@/lib/hosted/backup`.
