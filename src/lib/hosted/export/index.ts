/**
 * App export and import — the "you can leave" file (G21, G27).
 *
 * **What an export is.** One JSON document holding the app record, its release
 * history, the file table of the artifact it is serving, its access manifest
 * and every equipment request in it. It is a customer's own data in a shape
 * another install of this product can read back, and a shape a person can read
 * with `jq`.
 *
 * **What an export is not, and says so in `limitations`.** It does not carry
 * the app's *source* — the platform builds from a pinned recipe and stores the
 * built artifact, so what an export can honestly list is the artifact's file
 * table, not the code that produced it. It does not carry artifact bytes. It
 * does not carry sessions, invitation tokens or anything else that would let
 * the file itself grant access to anybody.
 *
 * **What an import restores: data, and access *intent*.** Records come back
 * with their original ids, versions and timestamps, so history is preserved
 * rather than re-created. Access does not: a grant is bound to a subject
 * issued by an identity provider, and those subjects do not travel between
 * installs. Every person on the imported access manifest therefore arrives as
 * a `needs_reapproval` grant with a placeholder subject that can never match a
 * real caller. An owner has to re-grant each of them to a real identity.
 * "Everyone who had access has access again" is exactly the claim this refuses
 * to make.
