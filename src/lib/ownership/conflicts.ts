/**
 * Conflict detection: a writer targeting a field owned by someone else is
 * refused, or needs an explicit, approved ownership transfer.
 *
 * Two enforcement points share `evaluateWrite`:
 *   - proposal time: `checkNativeOperation` (service.scale, deployment.deploy,
 *     drift.repair, ...) against the owner of the fields the operation writes;
 *   - plan time: `checkPlanFieldOwnership` over a normalized OpenTofu plan,
 *     where the writer is always IaC.
 *
 * Verdicts:
 *   allowed            the writer owns the field (or is seeding a new object)
 *   transfer_required  another owner holds it; an approved transfer to the
 *                      writer would make this legal. The request carries the
 *                      exact digest an approval must bind.
 *   refused            nobody may write it (provider-managed), or the writer is
 *                      the field's base owner while a transfer has moved it away.
