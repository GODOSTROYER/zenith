/**
 * The field-ownership registry: (resource type, field path) -> owner.
 *
 * Rules are declarative and pure. Registering two rules that claim the same
 * field of the same resource type is refused: that is exactly the "competing
 * writers" this registry exists to prevent. Facts (an attached autoscaler, a
 * release-managed image) pick the owner within one rule; approved transfers
 * move a single field of a single resource and are honoured only while they
 * still match the rule they were approved against.
 *
 * Anything with no rule is owned by `iac` (declared in the manifest), with
 * `source: "default"` so callers can tell "explicitly owned" from "assumed".
