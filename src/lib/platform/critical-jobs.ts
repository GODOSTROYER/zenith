/**
 * Critical periodic jobs: one registry, one execution wrapper, one health view (PROD-OBS-04).
 *
 * The durable scheduler is a Temporal Schedule (`zenith-critical-maintenance-v1` for reaping,
 * housekeeping and runbooks; `zenith-reconcile-sweep-v1` for observation and the COST-03 optimizer
 * pass) served by the execution worker. The GitHub Actions cron and the in-process scheduler are
 * kept only as a *fallback trigger* and run the very same functions through `runCriticalJob`, so
 * both sources are idempotent with each other:
 *
 *  - Overlap prevention: each run holds a fenced database lease (`critical-job:<job>`); a second
 *    trigger from any source while one runs gets `busy` and does nothing. Temporal's own overlap
 *    policy is SKIP; the lease is what also excludes the HTTP fallback.
 *  - Fencing: the run record is stamped with the lease fence and only that fence may finish it, so
 *    a holder that lost its lease cannot overwrite the new holder's record.
 *  - Missed-run catch-up: every job is level-triggered and idempotent (it re-derives due work from
 *    durable rows), so a gap is closed by exactly one immediate pass, never by replaying missed
 *    ticks. The gap is recorded (`missed_ticks_total`) so an outage is visible afterwards.
 *  - Fallback deferral: while the durable scheduler has succeeded within `FALLBACK_DEFER_MS`, a
 *    fallback trigger is skipped (and counted). When the durable scheduler is down, the first
 *    fallback trigger after that window runs the job, so cron still keeps the platform alive.
 *  - Visibility: `platform.scheduled_job_runs` keeps last run/success/failure counts per job;
 *    `criticalJobHealth` classifies them, and `/api/internal/tick/status` exposes it.
