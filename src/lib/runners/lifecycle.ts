/**
 * Agent delivery lifecycle (PROD-MACH-04): what the control plane shows about a
 * runner or zenithd machine's connection, durable result spool and release.
 *
 * Two kinds of fact, kept apart on purpose:
 *  - DERIVED by the control plane, trusted: revoked, and offline (no heartbeat
 *    for 90 s on the store's clock). These alone decide whether work is taken
 *    or dispatched.
 *  - REPORTED by the agent in its heartbeat, informational: its own connection
 *    state, how many results wait in its durable spool, and its release state.
 *    A report is validated, bounded and redacted, never trusted for authority,
 *    and a malformed one is dropped without failing the heartbeat (liveness
 *    must not depend on telemetry).
 *
 * The result is one `connection` state an operator can read:
 *   revoked     the agent was revoked; it takes no work and is told to stop
 *   offline     silent past the stale threshold; no work is dispatched; results
 *               it produced meanwhile wait in its spool
 *   recovering  heard from again, but it still holds spooled results, reports
 *               shaky connectivity, or just came back; replay is in progress
 *   online      healthy
