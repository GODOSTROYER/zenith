/**
 * Which URL paths authenticate by agent signature instead of a browser session.
 *
 * `src/middleware.ts` runs the Supabase cookie gate on every `/api/*` request
 * and answers 401 "Sign in to use the API" to anything without a session. Agents
 * have no session — their per-request Ed25519 signature is the authentication
 * (`request-auth.ts`) — so the middleware must let exactly these paths through
 * and no others. The admin routes (`…/runners/tokens`, `…/{id}/revoke`, the
 * list routes) are NOT in this set: they need a signed-in admin.
 *
 * The orchestrator wires this into the middleware bypass (see the WS-RUNSRV
 * handoff; `src/middleware.ts` is outside this workstream's paths).
