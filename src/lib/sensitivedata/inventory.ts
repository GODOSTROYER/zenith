/**
 * Sensitive persistence inventory (PROD-OPS-06).
 *
 * Every table, and every column that can plausibly hold sensitive data, with what it can hold, how it is
 * protected, how long it lives and how sure we are. The inventory is data, and a test (tests/security/
 * sensitive-inventory.test.ts) keeps it honest in both directions: a table or sensitive-looking column that
 * exists in the migrations but not here fails the suite, and an inventory entry for something that no longer
 * exists fails too. So new persistence cannot arrive unclassified.
 *
 * What the words mean (and do not):
 *  - `sealed`           the stored value is AES-GCM ciphertext under a registered key purpose. This is the only
 *                       protection that holds for a secret of any shape.
 *  - `write-guarded`    the repository refuses KNOWN credential shapes (assertNoSecretValues / assertNoSecretKeys)
 *                       or the writer redacts them. Best effort: a secret with no recognisable shape is stored
 *                       as given. Nothing here claims otherwise.
 *  - `digest-only`      a hash or digest is stored, never the value.
 *  - `tenant-content`   customer data by nature (app records, manifests). Protected by access control, not
 *                       encrypted by Zenith.
 *  - `host-protected`   plaintext on a worker's private volume, mode 0700, short-lived; the operator encrypts the
 *                       volume.
 *  - `none-needed`      the column cannot hold sensitive data by construction (ids, statuses, counts).
 *
 * `assurance` says how the claim is backed: `tested` (named test), `design` (named code control, no dedicated
 * test), `unreviewed` (inventoried and classified from its migration only; open follow-up).
