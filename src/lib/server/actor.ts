/**
 * Who is calling, and what they may do in the workspace they are calling into.
 *
 * One demo session = one local user ("You"); the Navigator identifies itself
 * with `navigatorHeaders()` — the actor header plus a process-local key — and
 * is then bound by the workspace autonomy level. The Navigator's in-process
 * path (lib/navigator/run.ts) never goes through HTTP at all, so nothing
 * outside this server can claim its name.
 *
 * `resolveRequest` lives here too: it is the identity half of what `route()`
 * settles before a handler runs, and `route()` reaches it by dynamic import so
 * this directory keeps a one-way import graph.
 *
 * Split out of `server/context.ts`, which re-exports everything here.
