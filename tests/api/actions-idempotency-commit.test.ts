/**
 * An idempotent outcome is retained only after the request that produced it
 * committed — and never before.
 *
 * On the Postgres store `save()` merely schedules the write; the durable round
 * trip is `await flushMutation(req)` inside `route()`, *after* `runAction` has
 * already returned. Retaining the outcome in `runAction` therefore left the
 * replay window holding `ok: true` for a mutation that a failed flush had
 * thrown away — and, since the window is now reported on the wire, asserting
 * `replayed: true` for it. So `route()` opens a commit scope, the runner keeps
 * the outcome *pending* inside it, and the scope promotes it only once the
 * flush resolves.
 *
 * The PostgREST client is faked at the supabase-js seam, exactly as
 * `postgres-request-boundary.test.ts` does it: `stale` makes the next `update`
 * match zero rows, which is the 409 version conflict the review named as one of
 * the two ways this flush fails in production.
