/**
 * PROD-REL-04: every live harness loads and enforces the scope manifest. This guard walks scripts/, src/ and tests/ and
 * fails when a file that reads a `ZENITH_LIVE_*` gate is neither wired to `scripts/release/scope` nor listed here with the
 * file that enforces it for it (which must itself import the scope module) or a manifest exemption with a reason. A new live
 * harness therefore cannot be added without deciding, in this file, how the manifest governs it.
 *
 * Out of scope here, stated: the `ZENITH_TEST_*` external lanes (an external Temporal namespace, a GitHub App) have their own
 * gates in scripts/ci/gate-manifest.mjs (EXTERNAL_ACCEPTANCE) and touch no cloud sandbox resources.
